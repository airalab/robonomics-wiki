**This article will tell you how to create virtual devices in a smart home, so you can see what the actual platform looks like.**

## Install integration

To use virtual devices you need to install ["demo" integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/demo/). 
To do this, you should edit your configuration file.

Go to the configuration folder, which you provided during the configuration process. In this folder, you will find a folder 
named "homeassistant". Go inside it. Open the `configuration.yaml` file with a text editor under the **root** user and insert the following line into it:

<code-helper copy>

```
...
# Example configuration.yaml entry
demo:
...
```

</code-helper>

After that, restart Home Assistant via web interface. When the smart home restarts, you can find all virtual devices in the "demo" entities. 
Find them in `Settings -> Devices & services -> Demo`. All these entities can be added to your dashboard.
