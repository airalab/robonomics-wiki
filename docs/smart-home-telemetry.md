1. Go to dApp and select [Devices & Control](https://robonomics.app/#/telemetry).

2. Make sure that you have selected the right subscription.

3. Telemetry downloading could take some time. Once it finishes, you will see the information from your devices and sensors. You can select either Parachain or Libp2p Provider.
