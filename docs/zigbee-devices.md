## Pairing Device

Open a web browser and go to `http://%PC_IP_ADDRESS%:8099`. You can find the IP address of Raspberry Pi 
using [Fing mobile app](https://www.fing.com/products) or [nmap CLI tool](https://vitux.com/find-devices-connected-to-your-network-with-nmap/). If you set up everything on your PC use `http://localhost:8099`.

You will see web-interface of Zigbee2MQTT:

It's time to connect your smart device. 
First, press `Permit join (All)` button at the top of web-interface of Zigbee2MQTT. 

Then, start to pair devices. The most common way to switch a device to connect mode is to hold its power button or switch them on/off 5 times. Make sure Zigbee2MQTT is running.

When the device connects, you will see them in web-interface:

Now you should see this sensor in your Home Assistant WebUI. Go to `Settings` -> `Devices & Services` -> `Devices`.

After adding all the sensors, you can close web-interface of Zigbee2MQTT.
