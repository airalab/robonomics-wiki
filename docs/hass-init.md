**After installing Home Assistant, it needs to be initialized.**

<robo-wiki-picture src="home-assistant/ha_init.png" />

You are starting with the creation of the owner account of Home Assistant. This account is an administrator and can make any changes. 
Open web browser and go to `http://%PC_IP_ADDRESS%:8123`. You can find the IP address of Raspberry Pi using [Fing mobile app](https://www.fing.com/products) or [nmap CLI tool](https://vitux.com/find-devices-connected-to-your-network-with-nmap/). 
If you set up everything on your PC use `http://localhost:8123`.

<robo-wiki-note type="note">IP address may change in time, due router settings.</robo-wiki-note>

1. At the first page, enter a name, username, password and click on the `CREATE ACCOUNT` button.

2. On the next screen, enter a name for your home and set your location and unit system. Click `DETECT` to find your location and set your time zone and unit system based on that location. If you don't want to send your location, you can set these values manually.

3. After that, Home Assistant will show any devices that it has discovered on your network. Donâ€™t worry if you see fewer items than what is shown below; you can always manually add devices later. For now, just click `FINISH` and you will be on the main Home Assistant screen.

4. Finally, you will see the Home Assistant web interface, which will show all of your devices.
