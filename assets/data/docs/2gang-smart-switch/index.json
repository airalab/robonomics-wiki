However, since all devices are development kits, the instructions will cover the option of flashing the device from scratch. If you do not wish to do this now, proceed to [**Step 2 - Access Point**](/docs/ir-controller/#step2).\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\nTake the device from the box and connect it to the computer. Then go to the website [webflasher.robonomics.network](https://webflasher.robonomics.network/). This is the web flasher.\n\n<robo-wiki-video autoplay loop controls :videos=\"[{src: 'https://crustipfs.live/ipfs/QmZ6kYAusdjH3Yq7L9UzorZdfXAa4awD1twp5SB5z57z9R', type:'mp4'}]\" />\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"warning\"> Note! Web flasher is working only with Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge browser.</robo-wiki-note>\n\nIn \"Firmware\" drop-box choose **\"SWS-2G-E-11-23\"** option and next in \"SELECT CHIP\" choose **\"ESP32\"**. Press **\"CONNECT\"** button.\nA popup window will appear where you should select the serial port to which the device is connected (usually it's `/ttyUSB0`). Then choose **\"INSTALL SWS-2G-E-11-23\"**. \nOn next window, you can make **CLEAR INSTALLATION** by check **ERASE DEVICE**. Press Next and then Install. Wait until firmware to upload to Smart switch device.\n\nAfter finishing the installation process, a Wi-Fi configuration popup will appear. Provide Wi-Fi credentials.\n\nAfter setting up Wi-Fi, you can visit the device via **VISIT DEVICE** button. Later, you can visit device via it's IP address in the network. To find it you can use [Fing mobile app](https://www.fing.com/products) or \n[nmap CLI tool](https://vitux.com/find-devices-connected-to-your-network-with-nmap/).\n\nSkip **Step 2 — Access Point** and go to [**Step 3 — Configuration**](/docs/ir-controller/#step3).\n\n<robo-wiki-title :type=\"2\" anchor=\"step2\">\nStep 2 — Access Point\n</robo-wiki-title>\n\nIf you take the Smart switch from the box and connect it to the power supply, it will create a hotspot with the name \"robonomics-XXXXXXX\". Connect to it. \nA configuration window should open. If not, open a web-browser and go to `192.168.4.1` page.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"ir-controller/phone-wifi.jpg\" />\n\nProvide Wi-Fi credentials. After that, the Smart switch device will connect to Wi-Fi network. Check the device via it's IP address in the network. To find it you can use [Fing mobile app](https://www.fing.com/products) or \n[nmap CLI tool](https://vitux.com/find-devices-connected-to-your-network-with-nmap/).\n\n<robo-wiki-title :type=\"2\" anchor=\"step3\">\nStep 3 — Configuration\n</robo-wiki-title>\n\n<robo-wiki-video autoplay loop controls :videos=\"[{src: 'https://crustipfs.info/ipfs/QmZokF8TnReLt4B6q8ixkBmpZwpiiU9PQCPdyJw9RcnYFn', type:'mp4'}]\" />\n\nGo to **\"Configuration\"**->**\"Configure other\"**. In **\"Template\"** string insert next:\n\n<code-helper copy>\n\n```shell\n{\"NAME\":\"Robonomics-2L-Switch\",\"GPIO\":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,576,1,1,1,1,3200,5440,0,224,225,0,0,320,1,321,0,0,0,0,33,1,32,1,1,0,0,1],\"FLAG\":0,\"BASE\":1}\n```\n\n</code-helper>\n\nVerify that checkbox **\"Activate\"** and **\"MQTT Enable\"** is enabled. If not, enable it and press Save button.\n\nReturn to the main menu and go to **\"Configuration\"** -> **\"Configure MQTT\"**.\nProvide your MQTT credentials here:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"ir-controller/mqtt.jpg\" />\n\nThat's all with ESP for now. The next step is to install the Home Assistant integration.\n\n<robo-wiki-title :type=\"2\" anchor=\"step4\">\nStep 4 — Integration setup\n</robo-wiki-title>\n\nThis article assumes, that you have Home Assistant. To connect Smart Switch device to Home Assistant, you need to install Tasmota integration.\n\n<robo-wiki-video autoplay loop controls :videos=\"[{src: 'https://crustipfs.art/ipfs/QmXLSLSFJKrrEtQXVQbpeFAvsKFSgW15J9ZFaSH1pteMXR', type:'mp4'}]\" />\n\nBasically, Home Assistant will discover Tasmota integration automatically. But if not, add it manually.\nThat's all. Now you can add switch entity to the dashboard.\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"warning\">  \n\nAll devices from Robonomics can be purchased on the official [website](https://robonomics.network/devices/).\n\n</robo-wiki-note>","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"2gang-smart-switch.md","name":"2gang-smart-switch"}}},"context":{}}
