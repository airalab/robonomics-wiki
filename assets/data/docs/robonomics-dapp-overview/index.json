It is available in browsers with [Metamask extension](https://metamask.io). On the first page you will see the statistics of the network:\n\n![Robonomics DApp's first page](./images/robonomics_dapp_first_page.jpg \"Robonomics DApp's first page\")\n\nLet's have a look at the bottom table \"Robonomics Telemetry\".\n\nEvery time an instance of AIRA is launched it broadcasts a piece of information about itself. Usually it takes some time for the Dapp to receive data from an instance of AIRA.\n\nHave a brief look at the page [\"AIRA installation\"](/docs/aira-installation) to understand where `IPNS` and `Address Eth` came from.\n\n## IPNS\n\nYou can treat it as a unique identifier of your instance in IPFS network. Under that name AIRA publishes metadata about itself.\n\n## Address Eth\n\nBy default AIRA generates new Ethereum address for you (it's [possible](/docs/aira-faq#how-to-change-ethereum-address-of-aira) to generate new one).\n\nIt's mainly used to sign all the outcoming messages.\n\n## Lighthouse\n\nIn Robonomics Network an agent must choose a lighthouse to work on. By default it's `airalab.lighthouse.5.robonomics.eth`.\n\nYou can choose existing one or create your own on [Lighthouses](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/lighthouse) page.\n\n## Peers\n\nThe amount of IPFS pubsub [peers](/docs/aira-faq#how-to-check-the-quantity-of-ipfs-peers).\n\n## Date\n\nThe date and time of last update\n\n## Network\n\nRobonomics Network officially works in Ethereum Mainnet.\nThere is also [Sidechain](https://github.com/airalab/airalab-sidechain) which is mostly for testing purpose.\n\n\n"}},"context":{}}
