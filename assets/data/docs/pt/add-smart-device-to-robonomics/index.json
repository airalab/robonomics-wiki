After you've added your devices, you need to add them in a `config.config` file with their seeds. Firstly in `Configuration/Entities` tab in your Home Assistant find entity ids of your devices:\n\n![entity_id](../images/home-assistant/entity_id.png)\n\nOpen the configuration file:\n```bash\nnano /srv/homeassistant/python_scripts/config.config\n```\nAnd add there information of your devices in the following format:\n\n```\n[device_name]\nIDS = ['entity_id1', 'entity_id2']\nSEED = word word word\n```\nWhere `device_name` is the name of your device (you can choose any name), `IDS` are entity ids of the data from the device (it may be one or more ids) and `SEED` is a mnemonic or raw seed from robonomics account to this device.\n\nAfter you fill the configuration file you need to get access token from Home Assistant. For that open your `profile` in the lower left corner:\n\n![profile](../images/home-assistant/profile.png)\n\nIn the end of the page find `Long-Lived Access Tokens` and press `create token`. Save it somewhere, you will not be able to see it again.\n\n![token](../images/home-assistant/token.png)\n\nNow run `create_config.py` script with your token:\n\n```bash\ncd /srv/homeassistant\nsource bin/activate\npython3 python_scripts/create_config.py --token <access_token>\n```\nAnd restart Home Assistant:\n```bash\nsystemctl restart home-assistant@homeassistant.service\n```\n\nYou can add the data from sensors to your homepage like in `Home Assistant setup` in the description to [Method 1](/docs/zigbee2-mqtt/).\n\nYou can see the data in [subscan](https://robonomics.subscan.io/), find your account and you will see datalog transactions. Data looks like this:\n\n![datalog_data](../images/home-assistant/datalog_data.png)\n\nYou can decrypt it with script `decrypt.py`, run it with the data from datalog:\n```bash\ncd /srv/homeassistant/\nsource bin/activate\npython3 python_scripts/decrypt.py <data>\n```"}},"context":{}}
