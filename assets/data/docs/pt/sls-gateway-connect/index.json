Open web interface then go to `Configuration/Integrations` page and press `Add Integration` button. Find MQTT:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/mqtt.jpg\" />\n\nPress on it and set up your brocker address (localhost), port (1883) and your username and password (default `user` and `pass` if you haven't changed it [here](/docs/raspberry-setup/)), then press `submit`:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/mqtt-setup.jpg\" />\n\nThen press on three dots on MQTT integration and choose `System Options` and check if automatically adding new devices is enabled:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/add-dev.jpg\" />\n\n## MQTT on SLS Gateway\n\nAlso you need to configure MQTT on SLS Gateway. Come back to your [SLS Gateway](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/sls-setup/#setup) go to `Settings/Link` -> `MQTT Setup`:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/sls-mqtt-menu.jpg\" />\n\nAnd add your brocker address (address of the Raspberry Pi with Home Assistant in local network), port (1883) and your brocker username and password (default `user` and `pass` if you haven't changed it [here](/docs/raspberry-setup/)). Also write the topic name (you can choose any). \n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"warning\">Don't forget to tick `Enable` and `Retain states`.</robo-wiki-note>\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/sls-mqtt1.jpg\" />\n\nSave changes. Now devices will be automatically shown in Home Assistant.\n\nAfter that you can connect your devices to Robonomics with this [instruction](/docs/add-smart-device-to-robonomics).","tools":[]}},"context":{}}
