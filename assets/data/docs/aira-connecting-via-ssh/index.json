In this section we will configure VM.\n\n> **It's required to have your ssh public key on Github. In case you don't have one, please follow the [link](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account/)**\n\nBelow is the walkthrough video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/R6waDG5iwm0\n\n## Add Host Adapter\n\nGo to `File` -> `Host Network Manager...` or press `Ctrl+H`\n\n![VirtualBox Network Manager](./images/virtualbox_network_manager.png \"VirtualBox Network Manager\")\n\nClick `Create` button.\n\n## Add the Second Adapter to the VM\n\nSelect imported VM and click `Settings`. Go to `Network` tab and enable the second adapter\n\n![Add Second Adapter](./images/add_second_adapter_to_vm.png \"Add Second Adapter\")\n\n## Populate Authorized Keys\n\nLaunch the VM and run the following command replacing `<username>` with your Github user name:\n\n```\nmkdir .ssh\nchmod 700 .ssh\ncurl -sSL https://github.com/<username>.keys >> .ssh/authorized_keys\n```\n\nFind out the VM's IP address by running:\n\n```\nip a\n```\n\nYou should look for an address which starts with `192.168.xx.xx`\n\n## Log in via SSH\n\nNow open your terminal and log in via SSH as usual using the address from the previous step:\n\n```\nssh root@192.168.xx.xx\n```\n"}},"context":{}}
