Make sure that your configuration is set up properly with the following settings:\n      - 'Gateway': '/ip4/0.0.0.0/tcp/8080'\n      - Ports 4001, 5001, and 8080 are available.\n      Also, add the following bootstrap nodes:  \n      1.

If HACS is not installed on your Home Assistant yet, you need to [install](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download/) it first.\n\nNext, in your Home Assistant, navigate to HACS and search for `Robonomics`: \n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/hacks-search.png\" />\n\nOpen it and click `Download`  in the bottom right corner. Downloading the repository may take some time. \n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/hacs-download-integration.png\" />\n\nThat's all.
