parts in the Robonomics network:\n\n- IPFS for the messages exchanging\n- the Ethereum blockchain for storing new liability contracts\n- a provider that is responsible for matching messages\n- an agent\n\nLet's have a look at the following diagram that describes the scenario without any additional details:\n\n![The main scenario of Robonomics Network](./images/robonomics_network_scenario.jpg \"The main scenario of Robonomics Network\")\n\nThere are three types of [messages](/docs/market-messages) in IPFS: Demand, Offer, Result.\n\n**Below there is the specification for a Demand message:**\n\n| Field         | Type                      | Description                                       | Example                                           |\n|--------------

This field determines the amount of fee for a lighthouse.\n\nNow let's have a look at the following diagram and walk step by step from the moment of publishing messages to a liability finalization.\n\n![Robonomics Network detailed scenario](./images/robonomics_network_detailed_scenario.jpg \"Robonomics Network detailed scenario\")\n\nA liability contract is created only if the following fields match: `model`, `objective`, `token`, `cost`. A provider of Robonomics Network watches every message and finds those ones that have a match.\nAfter the match is found the provider calls `createLiability(demand, offer)` method from the contract factory where `demand` and `offer` are serialized.\n\nBelow is the package diagram for the Robonomics communication stack:\n\n![Robonomics communication stack](./images/robonomics_network_communication_stack.jpg \"Robonomics communication stack\")\n\nThe factory deserializes arguments and recovers *promisee* and *promisor* addresses from signatures.\n\nNext step is token transfer. The factory transfers **cost** tokens from the *promisee* address and **validatorFee** and **lighthouseFee** from the *promisor* address to the new liability address.\n\n> - **You should approve sufficient amount of tokens for the factory.**\n> - **It's not required to approve tokens from the *promisor* address if fees are null.**\n\nNow the factory emits a NewLiability event with the liability address. An agent gets the address, reads fields, perform a task and at the same time writes a log file in rosbag format.\n\nWhen the work is done the agent sends a Result message with the following fields: hash of the rosbag file, a success flag, a signature. If the **validator** field is not null it means that only validator is able to finalize the liability.\n\nAfter the successful liability finalization the agent gets **cost** tokens. Otherwise, the *promisee* gets tokens back."}},"context":{}}
