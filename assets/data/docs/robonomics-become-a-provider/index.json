You must have access to a private key of the address. In case you don't have one, below are steps to create an address via [Parity](https://www.parity.io/ethereum/).\n\n```\n$ sudo snap install parity\n$ parity.ethkey generate random\nsecret:  15abe71557c07b69537bbe4352ed10a057be89037c69d4b35556112519911539\npublic: 38b800bfd90d486c78c646da79bb94b9d038aca8aad221062ce1b148df7764bfef02f6b3cf931786b6997540b798ea226ae60bd201c222d8f702e408a1a5cbff\naddress: c531fa8f141493df3da264a864bdcbec19695b4c\n```\n\nThe `secret` field is a private key, you'll need it to run the provider client. Save it to a file:\n\n```\n$ echo '0x15abe71557c07b69537bbe4352ed10a057be89037c69d4b35556112519911539' > private.key\n```\n\nThe next step is to deposit some ethers and XRT tokens to the address which is held in the `address` field.\n\n## Create a lighthouse\n\nGo to the lighthouse [dapp](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/lighthouse) and fill in a name in the right side:\n\n![The Right Side](./images/become_a_provider_1.jpg \"The Right Side\")\n\nClick on the `Create lighthouse and connect to the network` button and sign a transaction. After a while you should see:\n\n![Success of Creating a Lighthouse](./images/become_a_provider_2.jpg \"Success of Creating a Lighthouse\")\n\nNow it's time to put a stake. Select the new lighthouse and click `Connect to the network`:\n\n![Selecting the Lighthouse](./images/become_a_provider_3.jpg \"Selecting the Lighthouse\")\n\nOn this page in the `Provider` section click the `Approve` button, sign a transaction. When it's mined click the `Refill` button and do the same.\n\n## Install the client\n\nNow you need to install [robonomics-tools](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-tools) at least 0.4.2 version. You can build from the source or do the following steps:\n\n**Make sure you have Nix and Stack installed:**\n    \n```\n$ curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh\n$ curl https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh\n```\n\n* Setup Airalab binary cache at [https://aira.cachix.org](https://aira.cachix.org/)\n* Import Airalab channel:\n\n```\n$ nix-channel --add http://aira.life/channels/aira-unstable/ aira\n$ nix-channel --update\n```\n* Install from the binary cache:\n\n```\n$ nix-env -iA aira.robonomics-tools\n```\n* Run the client:\n\n```\n$ xrtd --lighthouse mobilerobotics.lighthouse.5.robonomics.eth --private $(cat private.key)\n```\n\n**Get familiar with the `xrtd` options via `xrtd --help`.**\n\n## Test the provider\n\nTo test your provider go again to the lighthouse [dapp](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/lighthouse/) and connect to the just created lighthouse.\n\nAt the bottom you should see the `TEST LIGHTHOUSE` section.\n\nClick on the `Demand` button and then on the `Offer` one. You should see something similar to:\n\n![Demand and Offer messages](./images/provider_mobilerobotics_demand_offer.jpg \"Demand and Offer messages\")\n\nDon't forget to sign every message with the MetaMask extension.\n\nFinally you should see a new liability contract created:\n\n![Liability is created](./images/provider_mobilerobotics_liability.jpg \"Liability is created\")\n"}},"context":{}}
