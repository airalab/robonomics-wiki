There is an [IPFS Add-on for Home Assistant](https://github.com/airalab/ipfs-addon).\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\nTo install it go to `Settings` -> `Add-ons` and press the `Add-on Store` button in the lower right corner.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/add-ons.jpg\" />\n\n\nThen press on three dots in the upper right corner and choose `Repositories`. Add there the following link:\n\n<code-helper copy>\n\n```\nhttps://github.com/airalab/ipfs-addon\n```\n\n</code-helper>\n\nThen press `Add` button:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/add-addon-repo.jpg\" />\n\nClose the repository manager and refresh the page. Now in the end of the page you can see IPFS Daemon Add-on:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/added-addon.jpg\" />\n\nOpen it and press `Instlall`. After it installed press `Run`:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/ipfs-addon-running.jpg\" />\n\n## HACS Installation\n\n[Home Assistant Community Store (HACS)](https://hacs.xyz/) allows you to install custom integrations.\n\nFirstly, you need to install add-on for connecting to the Home Assistant device with SSH. In Add-on Store search `ssh`. We recommend to install `SSH & Web Terminal` add-on.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/ssh-addons.jpg\" />\n\nChoose the add-on and press `Install`. After installation is finished, go to `Configuration` tab and add `password` or `authorized_keys`. Don't forget to save this part of configuration.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/ssh-configuration.jpg\" />\n\nAfter that in the `Info` tab press `Start`. If you want to see the addon in the sidebar, don't forget to enable `Show in sidebar`:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/ssh-addon-running.jpg\" />\n\nOpen SSH Add-on and run the following command:\n\n<code-helper copy additionalLine=\"Hass Command Line\">\n\n```bash\nwget -O - https://get.hacs.xyz | bash -\n```\n\n</code-helper>\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/ssh-install-hacs.jpg\" />\n\nAfter that restart Home Assistant (you can do it in `Settings`->`System`). Now HACS Integration will be available to add in the `Integrations` menu. Go to `Settings`->`Devices & Services`, press `Add Integration` and find HACS:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/hacs-integration.jpg\" />\n\nClick on it and follow the installation instructions. \n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"warning\" title=\"DISCLAIMER\">\n\n  To use HACS you need a Github Account.\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n## Robonomics Integration Installation\n\nNow you can install Robonomics Integration using HACS.\n\nOpen HACS and go to `Integrations`. Press on three dots in the upper right corner and choose `Custom Repositories`. In the opened window paste the following link:\n\n<code-helper copy>\n\n```\nhttps://github.com/airalab/homeassistant-robonomics-integration\n```\n\n</code-helper>\n\nAfter that, choose `Integration` category.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/hacs-robonomics.jpg\" />\n\nPress `Add`. You will see Robonomics in HACS Integrations. Click on it and press the `Download` button in the lower right corner. After downloading, restart Home Assistant.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/robonomics-download.jpg\" />\n\nNow you have two options:\n\n- If you have not yet used MQTT integration to connect smart devices via Zigbee adapter, go to the [**MQTT Broker for Home Assistant OS**](/docs/mqtt-hassos) article.\n- Otherwise, go to the [**IoT Subscription**](/docs/sub-activate) section and start activating the Robonomics subscription.","tools":["Home Assistant OS 9.3 https://github.com/home-assistant/operating-system/releases","Home Assistant 2022.11.4 https://github.com/home-assistant/core","Robonomics integration 1.1.3 https://github.com/airalab/homeassistant-robonomics-integration","robonomics-interface 1.3.6 https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/robonomics-interface/","IPFS 0.17.0 https://docs.ipfs.tech/"],"fileInfo":{"path":"hass-os-upgrade.md","name":"hass-os-upgrade"}}},"context":{}}
