In this folder, you will find a folder \nnamed \"homeassistant\". Go inside it. Open the `configuration.yaml` file with a text editor under the **root** user and insert the following line into it:\n\n<code-helper copy>\n\n```\n...\n# Example configuration.yaml entry\ndemo:\n...\n```\n\n</code-helper>\n\nAfter that, restart Home Assistant via web interface. When the smart home restarts, you can find all virtual devices in the \"demo\" entities. \nFind them in `Settings -> Devices & services -> Demo`. All these entities can be added to your dashboard.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/demo-entities.png\" />\n","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"virtual-devices.md","name":"virtual-devices"}}},"context":{}}
