Usually it is a single page web based application that helps to interact with an agent.\n\n## IPFS\n\nAccording to the official [documentation](https://docs.ipfs.io/introduction/) \"IPFS is a distributed system for storing and accessing files, websites, applications, and data\".\nFor more detail how it works go to the official website.\n\n## Lighthouse\n\nA lighthouse is an autonomous workflow that allows us to distribute the running time of providers that serve a single broadcast channel.\n\nFor more information read [Robonomics Whitepaper](https://static.robonomics.network/docs/whitepaper/Robonomics-whitepaper-en.pdf) section 5.2.\n\n## Sidechain\n\nEthereum based blockchain network with Proof-of-Authority consensus owned by Airalab.\n\n"}},"context":{}}
