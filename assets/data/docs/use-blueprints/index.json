Automations based on such blueprints only need to be configured. In web interface you can find pre-installed blueprints in `Settings/Automations & Scenes`. Open `Blueprints` and find the blueprint you want to use. In this example `Motion-activated Light` will be used. \n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/blueprint-settings.jpg\" alt=\"Blueprint Settings\" />\n\nClick on `Create Automation` to open the automation editor. Give a name, choose a blueprint to use (`Motion-activated Light` in our case). After that you need to choose motion sensor and lamp. When configuration is finished, click `Save`.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/automation-configure.jpg\" alt=\"Automation Configuration\" />\n\nIf you want to make changes, you can find it by going to `Settings/Automations & Scenes` and then `Automations`. \n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/automations-all.jpg\" alt=\"Automations List\" />\n\n## Importing Blueprints\n\nHome Assistant can import blueprints from the Home Assistant forums, GitHub and GitHub gists. List of all Blueprints are located on [Blueprints Exchange](https://community.home-assistant.io/c/blueprints-exchange/53). After you chose, go to `Settings/Automations & Scenes` and open `Blueprints`. Click on `Import Blueprint` and insert URL of the chosen blueprint. Then click on `PREVIEW BLUEPRINT`. In this case we will use [Low battery level detection & notification for all battery sensors](https://community.home-assistant.io/t/low-battery-level-detection-notification-for-all-battery-sensors/258664). \n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/importing-blueprint.jpg\" alt=\"Importing Blueprint\" /> \n\nThis will load the blueprint and show a preview in the import dialog. You can change the name and finish the import. Click on `Create Automation` to open the automation editor. Here you can configure automation's parameters and add actions to get notifications.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/configure-battery-blueprint.jpg\" alt=\"Configure Battery Blueprint\" /> ","tools":["Home Assistant 2022.11.3 https://github.com/home-assistant/core"],"fileInfo":{"path":"use-blueprints.md","name":"use-blueprints"}}},"context":{}}
