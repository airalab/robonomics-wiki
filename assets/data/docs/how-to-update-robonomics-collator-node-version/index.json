[\"how-to-build-collator-node\"](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-wiki/blob/master/docs/en/how-to-build-collator-node.md) & [\"how-to-launch-the-robonomics-collator\"](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-wiki/blob/master/docs/en/how-to-launch-the-robonomics-collator.md).\n\nThis article contains the commands required to update a Robonomics collator node (running on Ubuntu), and also gives an example afterwards.\n\n# **Required Commands**\n\n*Before you begin, it is recommended that you are logged in as Root, if not, then I would recommend that you use:*\n\n``sudo su -``\n\n1. Stop the robonomics service\n\n``systemctl stop robonomics.service``\n\n2. Remove previous version of Robonomics (make sure you are in the correct directory)\n\n``rm -f robonomics.X.X.X-ubuntu-x86_64.tar.gz``\n\n3. Get the latest release version of Robonomics\n\n``wget https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/vX.X.X/.....``\n\n4. tar -xf new file\n\n``tar -xf robonomics-X.X.X-x86_64-unknown-linux.gnu.tar.gz``\n\n5. Move the file\n\n``mv robonomics /usr/local/bin/``\n\n*(note, you need to move this file to the correct directory which you installed the Robonomics node)*\n\n6. Start Robonomics\n\n``systemctl start robonomics.service``\n\n# **Example when upgrading collator node to Robonomics v1.8.4**\n\n``sudo su -`` - log in to root environment\n\n``cd /home/admin`` - navigate to the correct directory (your directory may be different)\n\n``systemctl stop robonomics.service`` - stop Robonomics\n\n``rm -f robonomics-1.7.3-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`` - remove previous version\n\n``wget https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/download/v1.8.4/robonomics-1.8.4-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`` - download latest release version (in this example v1.8.3)\n\n``tar -xf robonomics-1.8.4-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`` - extract files\n\n``mv robonomics /usr/local/bin/`` - move files to desired location\n\n``systemctl start robonomics.service`` start Robonomics service\n\nNote: releases of Robonomics can be found here: https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/ \n\n\n","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"how to update robonomics collator node version.md","name":"how to update robonomics collator node version"}}},"context":{}}
