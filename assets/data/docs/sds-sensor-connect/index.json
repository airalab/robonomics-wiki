Our sensors utilize the Robonomics firmware, which is an enhanced version of the sensor.community firmware. It includes additional sensors and has a modified data sending mechanism. **\n\n1. Plug in the sensor into the socket to power it.\n2. The board will create a Wi-Fi network named `RobonomicsSensor-xxxxxxxxx`. Connect to it from your phone or computer: you will see the authorization window (if not, open the browser and go to `192.168.4.1`).\n3. Select your Wi-Fi network from the list (or write it yourself if it's not on the list) and fill in the password field.\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"okay\" title=\"INFO\">\nThe sensor can only be connected to a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network. \n</robo-wiki-note> \n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"sds-sensor-wifi.png\"/>\n4. Write the coordinates of the place, where the sensor will be installed. You can obtain them from any maps or obtain it from the address using [this link.](https://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long.html)\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"warning\" title=\"WARNING\">\nThe sensor coordinates will then be displayed on a publicly available map. If you do not want to show your private information, write close, but not exact coordinates.\n</robo-wiki-note> \n5. Click on `Save configuration and restart`. The board will reboot and connect to the specified Wi-Fi network.\n6. Open [Robonomics sensors map](https://sensors.robonomics.network/#/) and find your place where you installed the sensor. In a couple of minutes you will be able to see your sensor with data on map.\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"sds-sensor-map.png\"/>\n\n","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"sds-sensor-connect.md","name":"sds-sensor-connect"}}},"context":{}}
