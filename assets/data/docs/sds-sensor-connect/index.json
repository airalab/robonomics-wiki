It includes additional sensors and has a modified data sending mechanism. **\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"warning\">  \n\nAll devices from Robonomics can be purchased on the official [website](https://robonomics.network/devices/).\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n## Setup\n\n1. Plug in the sensor into the socket to power it.\n2. The board will create a Wi-Fi network named `RobonomicsSensor-xxxxxxxxx`. Connect to it from your phone or computer: you will see the authorization window (if not, open the browser and go to `192.168.4.1`).\n3. Select your Wi-Fi network from the list (or write it yourself if it's not on the list) and fill in the password field.\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"okay\" title=\"INFO\">\nThe sensor can only be connected to a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network. \n</robo-wiki-note> \n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"sds-sensor-wifi.png\"/>\n4. Write the coordinates of the place, where the sensor will be installed. You can obtain them from any maps or obtain it from the address using [this link.](https://www.latlong.net/convert-address-to-lat-long.html)\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"warning\" title=\"WARNING\">\nThe sensor coordinates will then be displayed on a publicly available map. If you do not want to show your private information, write close, but not exact coordinates.\n</robo-wiki-note> \n5. Click on `Save configuration and restart`. The board will reboot and connect to the specified Wi-Fi network.\n6. Open [Robonomics sensors map](https://sensors.robonomics.network/#/) and find your place where you installed the sensor. In a couple of minutes you will be able to see your sensor with data on map.\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"sds-sensor-map.png\"/>\n\n## Home Assistant \n\nThere are two installation options available:\n\n### Option 1: HACS\n\nThe easiest way to add a Local Luftdaten Sensor is through HACS. [Here](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/download/) you can find a brief explanation on how to set up HACS.\n\nOnce HACS is installed, navigate to HACS -> Integrations and search for the `Local Luftdaten Sensor` integration. Click on the download button and restart Home Assistant once the integration is downloaded.\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"sds-hacs.png\"/>\n\n### Option 2: Manual Installation\n\nUnder the `homeassistant` user, clone the project repository:\n\n<code-helper copy>\n\n  ```shell\n  git clone https://github.com/lichtteil/local_luftdaten.git\n  ```\n</code-helper>\n\nIf you already have any custom integrations, copy the `custom_components/local_luftdaten/` to your `custom_components` directory, For example:\n\n<code-helper copy>\n\n  ```\n  cd local_luftdaten\n  mv custom_components/local_luftdaten ~/.homeassistant/custom_components/\n  ```\n\n</code-helper>\n\nIf you don't have any custom integrations, copy the whole `custom_components` directory to your Home Assistant configuration directory. For example:\n\n<code-helper copy>\n\n  ```\n  cd local_luftdaten\n  mv custom_components/ ~/.homeassistant/\n  ```\n\n</code-helper>\n\n## Configuration\n\nCreate a new sensor entry in your `configuration.yaml` and adjust the host name or the IP address. To find the local IP address of your sensor, you can use [Fing mobile app](https://www.fing.com/products) or [nmap CLI tool](https://vitux.com/find-devices-connected-to-your-network-with-nmap/). Name can be any.\n\n|Parameter              |Type    | Necessity    | Description\n|:----------------------|:-------|:------------ |:------------\n|`host`                 | string | required     | IP address of the sensor\n|`scan_interval`        | number | default: 180 | Frequency (in seconds) between updates\n|`name`                 | string | required     | Name of the sensor\n|`monitored_conditions` | list   | required     | List of the monitored sensors\n\n<code-helper copy>\n\n  ```yaml\n  sensor:\n    - platform: local_luftdaten\n      host: 192.168.0.100\n      scan_interval: 150\n      name: Air quality sensor\n      monitored_conditions:\n        - SDS_P1\n        - SDS_P2\n        - HTU21D_temperature\n        - HTU21D_humidity\n        - signal\n  ```\n</code-helper>\n\n> A list of all supported sensors can be found in the [repository](https://github.com/lichtteil/local_luftdaten).\n\nRestart your Home Assistant.\nAfter that, you can add a sensor to your dashboard. The name of the entity will be the name you added to `configuration.yaml`.\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"sds-configuration-card.png\"/>","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"sds-sensor-connect.md","name":"sds-sensor-connect"}}},"context":{}}
