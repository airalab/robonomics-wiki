It contains Home Assistant Core with Robonomics integration and IPFS. Options for downloading:\n\n### GitHub Release\n\nDownload it from the latest [GitHub releases.](https://github.com/airalab/Robonomics-HomeAssistant-image/releases)\n\n### Image from IPFS\n\nAlternatively, you can download it using IPFS. [Install IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/), initialize and start the daemon:\n\n<code-helper additionalLine=\"your_username@your_hostname\">\n\n```shell\nipfs init\nipfs daemon\n```\n</code-helper>\n\nOpen the new terminal and download the image:\n\n<code-helper additionalLine=\"your_username@your_hostname\">\n\n```shell\nipfs get QmP5SxwQHB4BNEAR6BBnBmv845SoPRnEbdDqCh1SrQo7gk -o rpi.img.xz\n```\n</code-helper>\n\n\n## Configure Image\n\nInstall [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) on your computer. Then, insert the SD card.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/insert-sd-card.gif\" alt=\"insert SD card\" />\n\n\nRun the Raspberry Pi Imager program. Choose required image as the operating system and ensure to select your SD card from the storage dropdown menu. In settings provide your Wi-Fi, password, choose your country from drop-down list and then `Write!` image. \n\n<robo-wiki-video controls src=\"https://static.robonomics.network/wiki/rasp-pi-imager.mp4\" />\n\nYou can find country codes [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes).\n\n## First Boot\n\n**Safely eject the SD card**, insert it into the Raspberry Pi and connect the power cable to your device. It should connect to your Wi-Fi network. \n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/first-start.gif\" alt=\"first boot\" />\n\nOnce your Raspberry Pi is connected, the red LED will light up and the green LED will flash for some time. Wait up to 5 minutes for the Raspberry Pi to boot up and register on the network. \n\nNow find the IP address of Raspberry Pi. To find it you can use [Fing mobile app](https://www.fing.com/products) or \n[nmap CLI tool](https://vitux.com/find-devices-connected-to-your-network-with-nmap/). Find the `robots-home` (optional name could be `Home(homeassistant)`) \nname of the host machine in the IP list. \n\nIn this example the address is `192.168.43.56`. \n\nConnect to Raspberry Pi with `ssh` command: \n\n<code-helper additionalLine=\"your_username@your_hostname\">\n\n```bash\nssh smart@192.168.43.56\n```\n\n</code-helper>\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\"> \n\nUser is `smart`, password is `robot`. \n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n## Next step\n\nNow you have a Raspberry Pi with firmware installed, go to the [Home Assistant Init](/docs/hass-init/) article.\n\n## Related videos\n\nhttps://youtu.be/qW4sjUaShWA\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n1. To change wi-fi setting later, use command `sudo raspi-config`.
