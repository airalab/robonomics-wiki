Home Assistant is an open-source home automation system that provides a centralized hub for controlling smart devices in your home network. By integrating with Robonomics, a decentralized cloud service, you can enhance the functionality and security of your smart home. In this article, we will provide step-by-step instructions on how to install Home Assistant with Robonomics on a Raspberry Pi, giving you the ability to automate and control various aspects of your home using a secure and decentralized solution. Let's get started!**\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/pre_installed_image.png\" />\n\nRobonomics Pre-installed Image contains:\n- Home Assistant Core\n- IPFS\n- MQTT Broker and Integration\n- Zigbee2MQTT\n- Robonomics Integration\n\n## 1. Downloading the Image\n\nTo simplify the installation process, a pre-made image can be used. It contains Home Assistant Core with Robonomics integration and IPFS. Options for downloading:\n\n### Option 1: GitHub Release\n\nDownload image-robonomics_homeassistant.img.xz with current update date from the latest [GitHub releases.](https://github.com/airalab/Robonomics-HomeAssistant-image/releases)\n\n### Option 2: IPFS get\n\nAlternatively, you can download it using IPFS. [Install IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/), initialize and start the daemon:\n\n<code-helper additionalLine=\"your_username@your_hostname\">\n\n```shell\nipfs init\nipfs daemon\n```\n</code-helper>\n\nOpen the new terminal and download the image:\n\n<code-helper additionalLine=\"your_username@your_hostname\">\n\n```shell\nipfs get QmS2Zw3F1x8UiSc15HgWDG9PC5wA4ox8DEmHTgCGmrzLDx -o rpi.img.xz\n```\n</code-helper>\n\n\n## 2. Configuring the Image\n\nInstall [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) on your computer. Then, insert the SD card.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/insert-sd-card.gif\" alt=\"insert SD card\" />\n\n\nRun the Raspberry Pi Imager program. Choose required image as the operating system and ensure to select your SD card from the storage dropdown menu. \nIn settings:\n- Set username and password (save default username \"pi\" to be easy to remember),  \n- provide your Wi-Fi name and password, \n- choose your country from drop-down list\nand then `Write` image. \n                   \n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\">Save Username and Password carefully, because these credentials will be needed in case of Troubleshooting</robo-wiki-note>\n                        \n<robo-wiki-video autoplay loop controls :videos=\"[{src: 'https://crustipfs.info/ipfs/QmSZM7uVizqQjLnKJy2kifs9uDZB91MgALDBARenkzU3mb', type:'mp4'}]\" />\n\nYou can find country codes [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes).\n\n## 3. First Boot\n\n**Safely eject the SD card**, insert it into the Raspberry Pi. Then **insert Zigbee adapter** into the Raspberry Pi.\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"warning\">It's important to insert Zigbee adapter before first start of raspberry Pi! \nIt's needed for autoconfiguration of zigbee network.</robo-wiki-note>\n\n**If you have the [JetHome USB JetStick Z2](https://jethome.ru/z2/?sl=en) (which has all the necessary firmware), you can simply proceed with these instructions. However, if you have another adapter, the first thing you need to do is to flash it with Zigbee2MQTT software. You can find instructions for your device [here](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html).**\n\nNext, connect the power cable to your device. It should connect to your Wi-Fi network. \n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/first-start.gif\" alt=\"first boot\" />\n\nOnce your Raspberry Pi is connected, the red LED will light up and the green LED will flash for some time. Wait up to 5 minutes for the Raspberry Pi to boot up and register on the network. \n\nNow find the IP address of Raspberry Pi. To find it you can use [Fing mobile app](https://www.fing.com/products) or \n[nmap CLI tool](https://vitux.com/find-devices-connected-to-your-network-with-nmap/). Find the `robots-home` (optional name could be `Home(homeassistant)`) \nname of the host machine in the IP list. \n\nIn this example the address is `192.168.43.56`. \n\nTo check that everything is working, open web browser and go to web page `http://%RASPBERRY_IP_ADDRESS%:8123`. In this example, it will be `192.168.43.56:8123`.\nIf everything is fine, you will see Home Assistant web interface. If webpage doesn't open, wait up to 5 minutes for the Raspberry Pi to boot up and try again. \n\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n1. To change Wi-Fi setting later you should login to your Raspberry Pi via `ssh` command. For this, open terminal on your computer\nand type ssh command with your username, which you create on \"Configuring the Image\" step(default one is \"pi\"). \n\n<code-helper additionalLine=\"your_username@your_hostname\">\n\n```bash\nssh <YOUR_USERNAME>@<Raspberry_PI_IP_ADDRESS>\n```\n</code-helper>\n\nand then use command `sudo raspi-config`.
