But you are usually tied to centralized cloud providers or expensive proprietary gateways. As a result, you as a user are always dependent on the hardware and infrastructure vendor to run your smart system. At the same time, your smart home cannot be truly smart without cloud statistics and analytics.\n\n<robo-wiki-video loop controls :videos=\"[{src: 'https://crustipfs.info/ipfs/QmStCDsEHCYwVYvnDdmZBMnobPmrgZx3iJLm65b8XNzKQa', type:'mp4'}, {src: 'https://crustipfs.info/ipfs/QmdZKkPJCa9GEN43iUBX81jfrFTDxcn7J6wWURrwNVwcKx', type:'webm'}]\"  cover=\"covers/cover-3.png\" />\n\n**We see two main problems with current smart homes:**\n\n1. You have no control over what data you share with the vendor or third party.\n2. Your smart home is vulnerable to shutdowns of centralized cloud servers. \n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/ha-problems.png\" />\n\nTo solve both problems, we suggest you to try Robonomics, our **secure**, **serverless** and **futuristic** decentralized cloud.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/ha-robonomics.png\" />\n\n## Steps to corporate-free cloud\n\nHere are some simple steps to create an affordable smart home using Home Assistant as a device communication application and Robonomics as a corporate-free, decentralized cloud platform. Robonomics leverages modern and secure Web3 technologies, ensuring enhanced security throughout the process.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/robonomics-secure-blockchain-smart-home_3.png\" />\n\n## Start here your smart home\n\nWe have prepared detailed guides on setting up a smart home on Robonomics. The steps may vary depending on your specific situation: whether you already have an operational Home Assistant with paired devices, or if you are starting from scratch to establish your smart home.\n\n<robo-wiki-grid-element-wrapper textAlign=\"center\" :columns=\"2\" flexible>\n  <robo-wiki-grid-element>\n    <robo-wiki-button link=\"/docs/sub-activate?topic=Upgrade Home Assistant OS\" label=\"For Home Assistant users\" block />\n  </robo-wiki-grid-element>\n  <robo-wiki-grid-element>\n    <robo-wiki-button link=\"/docs/hass-image-install\" label=\"For new users\" block />\n  </robo-wiki-grid-element>\n</robo-wiki-grid-element-wrapper>\n","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"robonomics-smart-home-overview.md","name":"robonomics-smart-home-overview"}}},"context":{}}
