This data can be transferred to different destinations.\n\nOn this page you'll find step-by-step instructions to connect an ESP board to the connectivity server provided by AiraLab.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* ESP8266/ESP32 like board with WiFi\n\n## 1. Get the software\n\n### On Windows\n\nInstall [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).\n\nInstall Ubuntu via Windows Store:\n\n![Windows Store](./images/windows_store.jpg \"Windows Store\")\n\nand clone the [package](https://github.com/airalab/sensors-connectivity)\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/airalab/sensors-connectivity\n```\n\nThe next step is to install python and dependencies:\n\n```\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pip\ncd sensors-connectivity\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### On Ubuntu\n\n```\nsudo apt update && sudo apt install python3-pip git\ngit clone https://github.com/airalab/sensors-connectivity\ncd sensors-connectivity\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n> You can ignore such warnings:\n>\n> ```\n> The script ... is installed in '...' which is not on PATH.\n> Consider adding this directory to PATH or, if you prefer to suppress this warning, use --no-warn-script-location.\n> ```\n\n### On NixOS\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/airalab/sensors-connectivity\ncd sensors-connectivity\nnix build -f release.nix\nsource result/setup.bash\n```\n\n## Flash Firmware\n\nLet's start from a ping firmware. Plug an ESP like board in. Edit firmware's configuration file `sensors-connectivity/boards/esp/ESP_PING/config.my`:\n\n```yaml\nstassid: \"ESSID\"            # put your wifi name\nstapsk: \"PASSWORD\"          # wifi password\nhost: \"34.90.113.108\"       # leave it for now\nport: 31313                 # leave it for now\ngeo: \"53.507520,49.252999\"  # put your \"latitude,longitude\"\n```\n\nThen from firmware's root folder run the script:\n\n```\ncd boards/esp/ESP_PING\n./flash_firmware.py\n```\n\nThe board should be ready. Go to [Sensors Connectivity Dapp](https://sensors.robonomics.network/#/) and look for your board at the specified GPS location. It could take up to 1 min for the board to appear on the map. \n\n"}},"context":{}}
