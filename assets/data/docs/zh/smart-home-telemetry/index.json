You will forward to DApp website. In first login give permission to website to use polkadot{.js} extension. You will see next:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/telemetry-start.jpg\" />\n\nFind address of your `user` account and press blue button:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/datalog-start.jpg\" />\n\nAnd you will see popup \"启动\" window:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/launch-window.jpg\" />\n\nLaunch command calls HomeAssistant service, first two fields are **service name** - \"Platform\" and **service function** - \"Name\". Let's find them.\n\nFor this go to your Home Assistant interface in browser -> `Developer tools` -> `SERVICES` and turn on `YAML mode`.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/ha-services.jpg\" />\n\nFind a service you need using a search field or choose from a drop-down list there.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/ha-light.jpg\" />\n\nLet's find a `light` service. You will see available functions(`turn_on`, `turn_off`, `toggle`). Choose `turn_on` function.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/ha-light-on.jpg\" />\n\nOn the picture you see **service name** - `light` and **service function** - `turn_on`. Write these statements to popup window of DApp.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/light-window.jpg\" />\n\nNext you need to find the sensor ID. For this go to `Overview` on the HA page. Find sensor, which you want to turn on(in this example it is the light) and press on it. \n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/light-name.jpg\" />\n\nYou will see a popup window and with a \"settings\" button on it the top-right corner. Press on it. The popup window will change. In the new window you will find required `entity_id`:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/entity-ha.jpg\" />\n\nCopy it and paste to field in our dapp:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/dapp-entity.jpg\" />\n\nFinally, press `SEND` button and sign transaction with your password. Wait until transaction is in block and check your light. It should be turned on (sometimes it takes a bit more time).\n\nCongratulations, You have fully installed and set up Your Home Assistant with Robonomics!\n-->\n","tools":["Robonomics 2.7.0-1 https://github.com/airalab/robonomics","Robonomics Dapp https://github.com/airalab/dapp.robonomics.network","Robonomics Home Assistant Integration 1.4.2 https://github.com/airalab/homeassistant-robonomics-integration"],"fileInfo":{"path":"zh/smart-home-telemetry.md","name":"smart-home-telemetry"}}},"context":{}}
