Requirements:**\n- ROS Melodic + Gazebo + RViz (installation manual [here](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation))\n- extra packages:\n```shell\nsudo apt-get install ros-melodic-gazebo-ros-control ros-melodic-effort-controllers ros-melodic-joint-state-controller\n```\n- IPFS up to [0.6.0](https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/v0.6.0/go-ipfs_v0.6.0_linux-386.tar.gz)\n- Robonomics node (binary file) (download latest release [here](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases). This tutorial tested fine on v1.1)\n\nHere is the video showing successful launch:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6BSOyRbmac8\n\n### 1. Set up a simulation\nDownload Curiosity rover package:\n```shell\nmkdir -p robonomics_ws/src\ncd robonomics_ws/src\ngit clone https://bitbucket.org/theconstructcore/curiosity_mars_rover/src/master/\ncd ..\ncatkin build\n```\nWe need to adjust starting conditions to make our rover spawn smoothly:\n- Go to\n\n`src/master/curiosity_mars_rover_description/worlds` and change line 14 of the file` mars_curiosity.world` to \n`<pose>0 0 8 0 0 0</pose>`\n\n- Go to\n\n`src/master/curiosity_mars_rover_description/launch` and change line 4 of the file `mars_curiosity_world.launch` to \n`<arg name=\"paused\" default=\"false\"/>`\n\nDon't forget to add source command to `~/.bashrc`\n`source /home/$USER/robonomics_ws/devel/setup.bash`\n\n\n- Reboot console and launch the simulation:\n\n```shell\nroslaunch curiosity_mars_rover_description main_real_mars.launch\n```\n![Mars rover](../images/curiosity-demo/rover.jpg?raw=true \"Mars rover\")\n\nNote: if the image is dark, e.g. shadowed, change `Camera` to `Orthorgraphic` in Gazebo toolbar.\nThe simulation can be closed for a while.\n\n------------\n\n### 2. Download Robonomics controller package\nTo download a controller package for Rover type in terminal:\n```shell\ncd ~/robonomics_ws/src\ngit clone https://github.com/PaTara43/robonomics_sample_controller\ncd robonomics_sample_controller\npip3 install -r requirements.txt\ncd ..\ncatkin build -DPYTHON_EXECUTABLE=/usr/bin/python3 # The controller supports python3\n```\n\n------------\n\n### 3. Manage accounts in DAPP\nSince we are testing, let us create a local robonomics network with robonomics binary file:\n```shell\n./robonomics --dev --tmp\n```\n\n![Running node](../images/curiosity-demo/robonomics.jpg?raw=true \"Running node\")\n\n\nGo to https://parachain.robonomics.network and switch to local node \n\n![Local node](../images/curiosity-demo/local_node.jpg?raw=true \"Local node\")\n\n\nGo to Accounts and create **CURIOSITY** and **EMPLOYER** accounts.\n\n**Important**! Copy each account's address (to copy address click on account's icon) and Curiosity's account **mnemonic seed** (obtained while creating the account)\nTransfer some money (units) to these accounts. You can read more about accounts in Robonomics [here](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/create-account-in-dapp/)\n\n![Account creation](../images/curiosity-demo/account_creation.jpg?raw=true \"Account creation\")\n\n\nAdd these addresses, seed and node address (defaults to `ws://127.0.0.1:9944` for developer node) in `config.config` in `robonomics_ws/src/robonomics_sample_controller/src`. No quotes.\n\n------------\n\n\n### 4. Start Robonomics\nIn a separate terminal launch IPFS:\n```shell\nifps init #you only need to do this once per IPFS installation\nipfs daemon\n```\n\nIn another separate terminal launch Curiosity simulation if it's not live:\n```shell\nroslaunch curiosity_mars_rover_description main_real_mars.launch\n```\nWait till it stays still\n\nIn another terminal launch the controller:\n```shell\nrosrun robonomics_sample_controller sample_controller.py\n```\n![Controller](../images/curiosity-demo/controller.jpg?raw=true \"Controller\")\n\n\nNow you can send a transaction triggering the Rover to start moving and collecting data. To do so, you can use the same portal https://parachain.robonomics.network.\nGo to `Developer->Extrinsics` and select Curiosity's employer account, `launch` extrinsic, Curiosity's account as a target account and `yes` as a parameter.\nSubmit the extrinsic.\n\n![Extrinsic](../images/curiosity-demo/extrinsic.jpg?raw=true \"Extrinsic\")\n\n\nThe robot should start moving. It won't accept commands from other accounts neither commands with `no` parameter. The rover will move around and collect data for about a minute.\nLater, when the job is done:\n\n![Job done](../images/curiosity-demo/job_done.jpg?raw=true \"Job done\")\n\n\nOn the Robonomics portal go to `Developer -> Chain state` and obtain a `CURIOSITY` datalog using “+” button with selected `datalog -> RingBufferItem` as query: \n\n![Datalog](../images/curiosity-demo/datalog.jpg?raw=true \"Datalog\")\n\nNow the IPFS hash of the telemetry is saved in the blockchain. To see the data simply copy the hash and find it on a gateway:\n\n![Data in IPFS](../images/curiosity-demo/data_in_ipfs.jpg?raw=true \"Data in IPFS\")\n\n\nThis telemetry is kept in a decentralized storage, and it's hash is stored in a blockchain!\n"}},"context":{}}
