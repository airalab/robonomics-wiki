This section is designed with an assumption that default Docker images and container of Home Assistant named \n  <u>homeassistant</u> are used.\n  2. IPFS will be installed and run as a <u>systemd</u> service on the host machine.\n  3. It is assumed that you have Python3.9 or higher installed.\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n## Install\n\nDownload the installation script and run it with bash:\n\n```shell\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-hass-utils/main/raspberry_pi/install_integration_docker.sh\nsudo bash install_integration_docker.sh\n```\n\nYou will see the following output:\n\n```shell\n<...>\nadded /dns4/3.pubsub.aira.life/tcp/443/wss/ipfs/QmWZSKTEQQ985mnNzMqhGCrwQ1aTA6sxVsorsycQz9cQrw\n<...>\nIPFS daemon installed and launched, use ipfs-daemon.service to manage.\n<...>\nExecuting subversion-1.14.2-r1.pre-install\nExecuting busybox-1.35.0-r17.trigger\nOK: 157 MiB in 165 packages\n<...>\nA    robonomics/utils.py\nChecked out revision 120.\nIntegration downloaded!\n```\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\" title=\"`custom_components` exists.\">\n\n  You may see an error like `mkdir: can't create directory 'custom_components': File exists`. This\n  means that you have already installed some custom components and the folder exists. Ignore this message.\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\nRestart the container:\n\n<robo-wiki-tabs>\n  <robo-wiki-tab title=\"Docker\">\n    <pre>docker restart homeassistant</pre>\n  </robo-wiki-tab>\n  <robo-wiki-tab title=\"Docker Compose\">\n    <pre>docker compose restart</pre>\n  </robo-wiki-tab>\n</robo-wiki-tabs>\n\n\n## Verify\n\nCheck that IPFS service is up and running:\n```shell\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ systemctl status ipfs-daemon.service \n● ipfs-daemon.service - IPFS Daemon Service\n     Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/ipfs-daemon.service; enabled; preset: enabled)\n     Active: active (running) since Thu 2022-11-03 11:30:39 UTC; 14min ago\n   Main PID: 4400 (ipfs)\n      Tasks: 12 (limit: 4416)\n     Memory: 141.9M\n        CPU: 3min 5.031s\n     CGroup: /system.slice/ipfs-daemon.service\n             └─4400 /usr/local/bin/ipfs daemon\n```\n\nYou will see the integration available while going through further steps of this tutorial.\n\nNow that the integration is added to the folder of custom components of Home Assistant, you have two options:\n\n- Whether you have MQTT integration installed and some Zigbee devices connected by either Zigbee2MQTT or any other hardware,\nproceed to [Robonomics subscription activation](/docs/sub-activate) and Robonomics Integration configuration.\n- Otherwise, navigate to [MQTT Broker](/docs/mqtt-setup/) installation where you also add MQTT integration to your Home\nAssistant and connect your Zigbee devices to your Home Assistant via preferred hardware.\n","tools":["Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi","Home Assistant 2022.8.2 https://github.com/home-assistant/core","Docker https://www.docker.com/","Robonomics integration 1.1.0 https://github.com/airalab/homeassistant-robonomics-integration","robonomics-interface 1.3.6 https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/robonomics-interface/","IPFS 0.14.0 https://docs.ipfs.tech/"],"fileInfo":{"path":"es/hass-install-docker.md","name":"hass-install-docker"}}},"context":{}}
