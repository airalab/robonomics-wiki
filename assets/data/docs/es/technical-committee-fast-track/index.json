For our example, let's create the same setup in our dev mode environment:\n![Techcomm membership](../images/technical-committee-fast-track/techcomm_membership.png)\n\nBriefly, the process of fast-tracking a proposal involves a few steps:\n1. Creating the proposal preimage\n2. Creating the proposal using the created preimage hash\n3. Technical committee votes on the created proposal\n4. Initiating proposal fast-tracking \n5. Technical committee votes regarding fast-tracking the proposal\n6. Voting on enacted proposal in the Democracy pallet\n\nFor example, let's set the free balance for the account *4EnEc9ZD1jpA1H3HpVzr1v6SGGYGrue2k9Ny5KzFHhti5xQv* to 10 XRT\n\n## 1. Creating the proposal preimage\nOpen the **Governance -> Democracy** page and click the **Submit preimage** button, and then input the required parameters:\n![Creating preimage](../images/technical-committee-fast-track/creating_preimage.png)\n\nAfter all fields are filled, then we need to save generated preimage hash (*0x691405ef2f4ee0aee5bfb9d1ac3d98413e528eb211d2b914aed980370b57822b* in this example). As we will need it in the next step.\n\nAfter saving the preimage hash we can click the **Submit preimage** button in this window and sign the transaction:\n![Sign submitting preimage](../images/technical-committee-fast-track/sign_submitting_preimage.png)\n\n\n## 2. Creating proposal using created preimage hash\nOpen the **Governance -> Tech. comm.** page and go to the **Proposals** tab:\n![Techcomm proposals interface](../images/technical-committee-fast-track/techcomm_proposals_interface.png)\n\nThen click **\"Submit proposal\"** button and create *democracy.externalProposeMajority(0x691405ef2f4ee0aee5bfb9d1ac3d98413e528eb211d2b914aed980370b57822b)* using your technical committee account and the preimage hash from earlier:\n![Create techcomm proposal 1](../images/technical-committee-fast-track/create_techcomm_proposal_1.png)\n\nAfter signing transaction, the proposal will appear on this page:\n![Created techcomm proposal 1](../images/technical-committee-fast-track/created_techcomm_proposal_1.png)\n\n## 3. Technical committee voting for created proposal\nOn this step the majority of the technical committee members need to vote **Aye** in this poll. For example:\n![First vote result](../images/technical-committee-fast-track/first_vote_result.png)\n\nThen we can decide to close this vote/poll using the **Close** button. After this action the proposal will appear on the **Democracy** page on the **external** table. You may wonder how can you see the **Fast track** button. This button appears and is active ONLY if we used the **democracy.externalProposeMajority** function:\n![Created democracy proposal](../images/technical-committee-fast-track/created_democracy_proposal.png)\n\n\n## 4. Initiating proposal fast-tracking\nGo to the **Governance -> Democracy** page and click on the **Fast track** button. In this newly opened window set the required parameters and click **Fast track**.\n![Fast track interface](../images/technical-committee-fast-track/fast_track_interface.png)\n\nAfter this, the fast-track proposal should now appear on the Technical Committee proposals page:\n![Techcomm fast-track proposal](../images/technical-committee-fast-track/techcomm_fasttrack_proposal.png)\n\n\n## 5. Technical committee voting for fast-track the proposal\nNow the technical committee need to vote unanimously for fast-tracking the earlier created proposal. It means that all six members need to vote **Aye**:\n![Fast-track vote result](../images/technical-committee-fast-track/fasttrack_vote_result.png)\n\nAfter this anyone can **Close** this voting, and the proposal will be enacted and moved from **external** table to active **referenda**:\n![Democracy enacted proposal](../images/technical-committee-fast-track/democracy_enacted_proposal.png)\n\n\n## 6. Voting on enacted proposal in Democracy\nNow at least one account needs to vote **Aye** on the referenda:\n![Voting for enacted proposal](../images/technical-committee-fast-track/voting_for_enacted_proposal.png)\n\nAs a result we'll get the active referenda with one positive vote on it:\n![Positive voted referenda](../images/technical-committee-fast-track/positive_voted_referenda.png)\n\nAfter the voting period ends, this democracy proposal will be executed. In current example this will be happen in block #3351. Let's wait for this block and check it:\n![Result](../images/technical-committee-fast-track/result.png)\n"}},"context":{}}
