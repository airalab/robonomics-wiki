Complete the process as described in this article (i.e. signing the message & raising a GitHub issue).\r\n2. Bridged $XRT will be sent to the account originally input into the Exodus bridge dapp (i.e. the incorrect account).\r\n3. If no transactions are made on the incorrect account for 1 month, then the Robonomics team will transfer the $XRT tokens to the new address stipulated in the message (which you will sign as per the instructions below).\r\n\r\nOf course, the utmost priority for the Robonomics team is to ensure only valid changes of address are executed, as such you need to sign a message **from the Ethereum account which you originally deposited the $XRT tokens into the Exodus dapp**. We recommend that you utilize a site such as [MyCrypto](https://app.mycrypto.com/sign-message) to create this message (the following images will show how to conduct this process on MyCrypto).\r\n\r\nSelect the icon which corresponds to your web3 wallet, in our case we will choose MetaMask.\r\n\r\n![MyCrypto.com-Landing-Page](https://i.imgur.com/fyJyBG0.png)\r\n\r\nNow, click on the \"Connect to MetaMask\" button as shown above, and select the correct account (the account which you previously **sent $XRT tokens from**).\r\n\r\n![Page-after-selecing-metamask](https://i.imgur.com/1rd6izf.png)\r\n\r\nNow, we get the option to input a message, you shall follow the below template when inputting the message into this section, otherwise the process will not work. **These addresses relate to the Robonomics parachain addresses**.\r\n\r\n>Wrong target address: **WRONG_ADDRESS**. Right target address: **RIGHT_ADDRESS**\r\n\r\nSo, your message will look something like the message below (please make sure you input your own address, and not the one shown below). The message should all be on 1 line, don't use any line breaks (i.e. pressing enter). Afterwards, press the \"Sign Message\" button located under the message text.\r\n\r\n![example-of-how-the-message-should-look](https://i.imgur.com/jb1YqLs.png)\r\n\r\nNow you should get a notification on your web 3 wallet, click \"Sign\".\r\n\r\n![Example-metamask-notification](https://i.imgur.com/GTHEYTs.png)\r\n\r\nOnce signed, wait a few moments and then the MyCrypto page should change, and a signature shall appear.\r\n\r\n![signature-generated-from-signed-message](https://i.imgur.com/JemAEPm.png)\r\n\r\nNext, you need to head on over to the [Robonomics GitHub page](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/issues/new), and open a new issue. The issue should have the title \"Robonomics exodus: a request to change the target address\", and the body / comment of the issue shall be the signature generated by MyCrypto. Afterwards, click \"Submit new issue\", and the Robonomics team will handle your issue and leave a reply to your issue regarding the status of your request.\r\n\r\n![example-of-GitHub-issue](https://i.imgur.com/6ZHSFRw.png)","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"es/changing-exodus-receiving-address.md","name":"changing-exodus-receiving-address"}}},"context":{}}
