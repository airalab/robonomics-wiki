The Rust installer will ask you about current installation options, you should choose the `1) Proceed with installation (default)` option.\n\n\n```\n  curl https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh\n  # on Windows download and run rustup-init.exe\n  # from https://rustup.rs instead\n  source $HOME/.cargo/env\n```\n![Install Rust](../images/how-to-build-collator-node/install_rust.jpg)\n\n\nInstall the required nightly toolchain and wasm target.\nNext commands actual for Robonomics v1.4.0:\n\n```\n  rustup install nightly-2021-11-02\n```\n![Install nightly](../images/how-to-build-collator-node/install_nightly.jpg)\n\n\n```\n  rustup default nightly-2021-11-02\n  rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown --toolchain nightly-2021-11-02\n```\nYou will also need to install the following packages:\n\n  1. Linux:\n\n  ```\n    sudo apt install cmake git clang libclang-dev\n  ```\n  2. Mac:\n\n  ```\n    brew install cmake pkg-config git llvm\n  ```\n  3. Windows (PowerShell):\n\n  ```\n    # Install git https://git-scm.com/download/win\n    # Install LLVM\n    # Download and install the Pre Build Windows binaries\n    # of LLVM  from http://releases.llvm.org/download.html\n  ```\nNow you can install the robonomics node from git source.\n\n```\n  cargo install --force --git https://github.com/airalab/robonomics --tag v1.4.0 robonomics-node\n```\n![Start build Robonomics](../images/how-to-build-collator-node/start_build_robonomics.jpg)\n![End build Robonomics](../images/how-to-build-collator-node/end_build_robonomics.jpg)\n\n\nAfter this command the compiled robonomics binary will be in `~/.cargo/bin` directory.\n\nThe next step is how to launch the collator node.
