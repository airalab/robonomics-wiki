Open web browser and go to \n`http://%RASPBERRY_IP_ADDRESS%:8123`(RASPBERRY_IP_ADDRESS you have found in previous [article](/docs/hass-install-image)).\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\">Raspberry Pi address may change in time, due router settings</robo-wiki-note>\n\nAt the first page, enter a name, username, password and click on “create account”.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/username.jpg\" alt=\"create user\" />\n\nNext, you can enter a name for your home and set your location and unit system. Click “DETECT” to find your location and set your time zone and unit system based on that location.\nIf you’d rather not send your location, you can set these values manually.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/location.jpg\" alt=\"set location\" />\n\nOnce you are done, click Next. In this screen, Home Assistant will show any devices that it has discovered on your network.\nDon’t be alarmed if you see fewer items than what is shown below; you can always manually add devices later.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/add-devices.jpg\" alt=\"additional devices\" />\n\nFinally, click Finish. Now you’re brought to the Home Assistant web interface.\nThis screen will show all of your devices. So let’s get that screen filled up! Proceed to [MQTT setup](/docs/mqtt-setup)\nto add MQTT integration and then - new devices!.\n","tools":["Home Assistant 2022.11.3 https://github.com/home-assistant/core"],"fileInfo":{"path":"es/hass-init.md","name":"hass-init"}}},"context":{}}
