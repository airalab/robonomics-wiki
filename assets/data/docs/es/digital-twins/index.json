Set\n up yours with [these instructions](/docs/run-dev-node).\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n## Theory overview\nAny account can create and manage a Digital Twin. The Twin may be imagined as some sort of table with the following\ncontents:\n\n| DT id  | Topic Name \t| Source    \t|\n|--------|------------\t|-----------\t|\n| 0      | 0x00...000 \t| 4Gz...hQJ \t|\n| 1      | 0x00...001 \t| 4GVi...Bn \t|\n| \t      | 0x00...002 \t| 4Hm...vLS \t|\n| \t      | 0x00...... \t| 4HQ...RQY \t|\n| n\t  | 0xFF...FFF \t| 4Hw...CyK \t|\n\n\n Where:\n* **DT id** is unsigned integer unique Digital Twin index.\n* **Topic name** is a hex `H256` or ASCII data of 32 bytes length, same as [`Launch`](/docs/launch) extrinsic parameter. \nFor example: `0x1234....FF` or  `hello.parachain.robonomics.world`.\n* **Source** - is some Account address.\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\" title=\"Topics\">\n\n  As have been discussed previously in Launch extrinsic overview, the `H256` may be represented as an encoded IPFS CID (see\n  [Python tool](https://multi-agent-io.github.io/robonomics-interface/modules.html#robonomicsinterface.utils.ipfs_qm_hash_to_32_bytes) for that).\n  Therefore, topics may be used as some data storage as well, say, a Twin's module description.\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n\n## Create Digital Twin\n\n### 1. Navigate to Developer -> Extrinsics\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"digital-twin/extrinsics.jpg\" />\n\n### 2. Choose digitalTwin -> create from the dropdown list of possible extrinsics\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"digital-twin/twin-create.jpg\" />\n\nSubmit the transaction. Here, no parameters needed to create a Twin. It will be granted an index and only the Digital\nTwin owner is able to add/modify topics of the Twin from now on.\n\nTwin ID may be found on the Explorer overview page.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"digital-twin/create-log.jpg\" />\n\n## Add Topic\n\n### Choose digitalTwin -> setSource from the dropdown list of possible extrinsics\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"digital-twin/set-topic.jpg\" />\n\n* `id` - Digital Twin ID, which has been obtained on the Explorer page.\n* `topic` - previously discussed `H256` topic name. In this picture it's a string of 32 symbols.\n* `source` - account address to be associated with the topic.\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\" title=\"Overwrite\">\n\n  Pay attention that the topic may be overwritten with another source address if needed.\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\nSign and submit the extrinsic.\n\n## Explore\n\nYou can find all information about existing Digital Twins in `Developer -> Chain state` storage module `digitalTwin`.\n\n- Total number of Twins - `total()`;\n- Digital Twin owner - `owner(u32)`;\n- Information about topics of a Digital Twin - `digitalTwin(u32)`.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"digital-twin/chain-state.jpg\" />","tools":["Robonomics 2.3.0 https://github.com/airalab/robonomics","robonomics_interface 1.3.6 https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/robonomics-interface"],"fileInfo":{"path":"es/digital-twins.md","name":"digital-twins"}}},"context":{}}
