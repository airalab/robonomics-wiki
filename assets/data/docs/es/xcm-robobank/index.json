This allows robots to operate inside Robonomics network with all needed infrastructure, but, in the same time, offer their services in any external parachain.\n\nVideo example is available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S_bZgsxngiM)\n\nThe demo scenary main steps are:\n- launch relay chain and two parachains in pack of 6 processes\n- setup XCM messages channels between parachains\n- register a robot in both parachains\n- create order for this robot in client parachain (reserving payment for completion of order)\n- send XCM message to Robonomica\n- creating \"mirrored\" order record in Robonomica parachain\n- accept order by robot in Robonomica\n- send XCM message about order acceptance back to client parachain\n- accept order in client parachain (reserving penalty fee for no-completion of order until deadline)\n- complete order by robot in Robonomica\n- send XCM message about order completion to client parachain\n- settle all payments (client payment is transfered to robot, as well as penalty fee)\n- close order\n\n\n## Upstream\nThis project is a fork of the\n[Substrate Developer Hub Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template).\nContains code of runtime pallets being tested.\nAs in original node code of parachains is in \"./pallets\", \"./runtime\", \"./node\" catalogs.\n\nDifferences with original \"substrate-node-template\":\n- this collator runtime has HRMP handler module and can handle messages from siblings parachains\n- mock test runtime ready-made for internal XCM tests\n\n## Build & Run\nRecommended(highly) setup: \n```\nUbuntu 20, 16 Gb RAM, 8 CPU, 120 Gb SSD\n```\n[NOTE] First build can take a lot of time, up to several hours on weak machines\n\n[NOTE] Script works with FIXED versions (commit hashes) of Polkadot(Rococo) in relay chain and parachains\n\n[NOTE] By default script re-creates same environment every launch, by removing all previous states. this behaviour can be changed in \"config.sh\" using \"PERSISTENT\" param\n\n\nRun build and setup script.  \n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/airalab/xcm-robobank-prototype.git\ncd xcm-robobank-prototype\n./scripts/init.sh\n```\n\nBasic actions of \"init.sh\" script:\n - read config (file \"config.sh\" with revision number, initial node keys and identifiers, chaindata persistence param, etc)\n - setup OS packets, Rust and Python\n - bulds separate binaries for relay chain and for both parachains\n    - binaries will be generated in ./bin subdirectory. \n - (optional) removes all previous chain data for all chains\n    - disabled if \"PERSISTENT=1\" is set in \"config.sh\"\n - runs as separate processes (with separate PIDs and I/O pipes):\n    - validators of relay chain (f.e. 4 validators of some stable Rococo revision)\n    - collators for parachain-100 (f.e. single collator for first parachain, that you're developing)\n    - collators for parachain-200 (f.e. single collator for second parachain, that you're developing)\n - prints all endpoints, ports to console, allowing to study any chain using frontend apps (explorer, DApp)\n - keep printing all output of all chains to console\n\n[WARNING] After launch, wait until a network is up, make sure that blocks finalization started, and parachains are registered. These processes require approximately 5 min (50 blocks x 6 sec ).\n\n## Checking if all works \n\nUse standard Polkdot frontend and generated \"--ws-port\" endpoints to connect with each node.\nOpen [Polkadot application](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://localhost:9500/) to monitor the chains. \n\n### Example:\nLocalhost, 4 relay chain validators, one parachain-100 collator, one parachain-200 collator:\n- [Relay validator 1](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://localhost:9500/)\n- [Relay validator 2](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://localhost:9501/)\n- [Relay validator 3](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://localhost:9502/)\n- [Relay validator 4](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://localhost:9503/)\n- [Parachain-100 collator](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://localhost:10054/)\n- [Parachain-200 collator](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=ws://localhost:10055/)\n\n\nIf everything works, consensus started off, we can proceed to run test cases (in a new terminal)\n\n### UMP message passing test\n```bash\n./scripts/init.sh ump\n```\nIt creates `Balance.transfer` message in `parachain-100` and passes it to relay.\nWhen relay receives message it will transfer 15 tokens from `para 100` account to the Charlie's.\n\n\n### HRMP message passing test\n```bash\n./scripts/init.sh ump\n```\n\nIt creates `Balance.transfer` message in `parachain-100` and passes it to `sibling 200` one.\nBefore that, it endows `subl 100` account with 1000 tokens and  establish a channel between the parachains.\n```bash\n./scripts/init.sh hrmp\n```\nNext messages can be sent by running `hrmpm` subcommand. It doesn't create a channel and so it runs faster.\n```bash\n./scripts/init.sh hrmpm\n```\n\n### More options\n```bash\n./scripts/init.sh help\n```\n\n## Local Testnet\n\n### Create customized chain spec\n```\n./bin/polkadot build-spec --chain rococo-local --disable-default-bootnode > rococo_local.json\n```\n\nEdit rococo_local.json, replace balances and authorities with yours.\n```json\n  \"keys\": [\n    [\n      \"\",\n      \"\",\n      {\n        \"grandpa\": \"\",\n        \"babe\": \"\",\n        \"im_online\": \"\",\n        \"para_validator\": \"\",\n        \"para_assignment\": \"\",\n        \"authority_discovery\": \"\"\n      }\n    ]\n```\n\nPolkadot address for //Alice//stash (sr25519 cryptography).\n```bash\n$ polkadot key inspect-key --scheme sr25519 --network substrate //Alice//stash\n```\n\n```text\nSecret Key URI `//Alice//stash` is account:\nSecret seed:      \n\nPublic key (hex): \n\nAccount ID:       \n\nSS58 Address:     \n```\n\nPolkadot grandpa session key for //Alice (ed25519 cryptography).\n```bash\n$ polkadot key inspect-key --scheme ed25519 --network substrate //Alice\n```\n```text\nSecret Key URI `//Alice` is account:\nSecret seed:      \n\nPublic key (hex): \n\nAccount ID:       \n\nSS58 Address:     \n```\n\nPolkadot address for //Alice (sr25519 cryptography).\n```\n$ polkadot key inspect-key --scheme sr25519 --network substrate //Alice\n```\n```text\nSecret Key URI `//Alice` is account:\nSecret seed:      \n\nPublic key (hex): \n\nAccount ID:       \n\nSS58 Address:     \n```\n\nConvert rococo_local.json to the raw format.\n```\n./bin/polkadot build-spec --chain rococo_local.json --raw --disable-default-bootnode > rococo_local.json\n```\nTo use new chain spec replace rococo.json file in ./config/ directory this new one and rerun chain.\n```bash\n./scripts/init.sh run\n```\nYou can freely edit code. The above command will rebuild project and update collator node before start.\nCumulus is pre-release software that is still under heavy development.\nWe are using a specific commit of polkadot [46c826f595021475fa5dbcd0987ed53f104e6e15  18 mar 2021] (https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/tree/46c826f595021475fa5dbcd0987ed53f104e6e15)\n\nYou can use more recent version of software. For this change  POLKADOT_COMMIT  in ./scipt/config.sh\nto the latest commit of `rococo-v1` branch, delete ./bin/polkadot, and run \n```bash\n./scripts/init.sh run\n```\n\nUpdate collator project dependencies \n```bash\ncargo update\n./scripts/init.sh build\n```\nSome dependencies probably require new rust toolchain features. This project is based on rust `nightly-2021-01-26`\nUpdate rust toolchain version in ./scripts/config.sh before build.\n\n## Hack parachain\n[Add external pallet](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/tutorials/add-a-pallet/) - should it probably be in \"learn more\"?\n## Learn More\n\nRefer to the upstream\n[Substrate Developer Hub Node Template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-node-template)\nto learn more about the structure of this project, the capabilities it encapsulates and the way in\nwhich those capabilities are implemented.
