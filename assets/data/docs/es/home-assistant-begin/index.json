There are instructions on how to connect your smart home devices to the Robonomics network. \n\nYou need Robonomics account(we will create them later) with a subscription, lets call it `SUB_OWNER`, and another account in devices of this subscription (it will be `SUB_ADMIN`). Both accounts should be ED25519 crypto type. \n\nDevices in the subscription are connected with Home Assistant users, so `SUB_OWNER` can add the device to the subscription and the user with the device account name will be added to Home Assistant. They can send `Launch` transactions with commands on `SUB_ADMIN` account to control smart devices connected to Home Assistant.\n\nAlso `SUB_ADMIN` will send to Robonomics encrypted telemetry with states of all sensors or smart devices in Home Assistant, so with `SUB_ADMIN` secret key you will be able to read telemetry from Datalog. \n\n## Requirements\n\n* Raspberry Pi 4\n* SD card and SD adapter\n* Zigbee smart devices (any from [supported devices](https://slsys.io/action/supported_devices.html))\n\n### Method 1 (with zigbee2MQTT)\n* Zigbee adapter [JetHome USB JetStick Z2](https://jhome.ru/catalog/parts/PCBA/293/) (or one of [supported](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html))\n\n### Method 2 (with SLS Gateway)\n* [Robonomics SLS Gateway](https://easyeda.com/ludovich88/robonomics_sls_gateway_v01)\n\n## Start\n\nLet's start. First you need to [setup Raspberry Pi](/docs/raspberry-setup/).\n","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"es/home-assistant-begin.md","name":"home-assistant-begin"}}},"context":{}}
