This integration allows Home Assistant to record datalogs with encrypted data from Home Assistant to Robonomics Parachain and listen launch commands from this Parachain to control smart devices. Integration use IPFS to store data and send IPFS hashes to  datalog or launch.\n\n## Configure\n\nNow you can add integration to Home Assistant. In web interface go to `Settings/Device & Services` and press `Add Integration`. Find there `Robonomics`:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/add-integration.jpg\" />\n\nClick on it and fill the configuration. Here you need to add seed from `SUB_ADMIN` and public address of `SUB_OWNER` accounts (which you previously created).\nAlso, you can set sending interval, by default it is 10 minutes.\n\nMoreover, you can add your Pinata credentials. It is not necessary, if you will not do it, data will be pinned with your local node and Infura.If you add the credentials files will also be pinned on Pinata to help them spread wider over IPFS.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/config.jpg\" />\n\n Fill in everything and press `Submit`. If is, you will see **Success** window. Close it.\n\n## Use DApp\n\nNow it's time to create the first user for your Home Assistant.It shouldn't be `SUB_OWNER` or `SUB_ADMIN` accounts, because,\nas said [earlier](/docs/iot-sub-setup/) they provide security. Because of it, regular user shouldn't use them. \nAlso, you can't use user, which you created af first start of Home Assistant, because this user don't have \naccount in Robonomics Parachain.\n\nCreate an account, as we did in the previous [article](/docs/iot-sub-setup/). \nAdd this account to the subscription [here](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/subscription/devices). Now there should be three addresses in the access list - `SUB_OWNER`, `SUB_ADMIN` and `user`.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/user.jpg\" />\n\nThen go to the Dapp service [**\"HomeAssistant Account\"**](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/home-assistant). Choose account, \nyou've just created at the right sidebar (check that you have chosen the intended account by pressing the profile icon).\nThen enter the `USER` seed in the required field. In the next two raws type in `SUB_OWNER` and `SUB_ADMIN` addresses:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/acc-pass.jpg\" />\n\nIf everything right, you will see ** 3. Verification status ** - `Verified`.\n\nCreate a password for a new HA user which you have just registered. Type the passport below `Your Home Assistant password` and click \"create password\". Confirm transaction. (Later you can restore it in \"restore\" tab.)\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/password.jpg\" />\n\nItâ€™s free now since the accounts are using RWS subscription. After the registration process, you can log in to Home Assistant with your address as `login` and a newly-created password. Go to login page and login:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/acc-login.jpg\" />\n\nNow you can use `SmartHome Telemetry` DApp to control your home through the Robonomics.
