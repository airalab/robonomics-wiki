Therefore, to check service status:\n\n```bash\nsystemctl status connectivity.service\n```\nThere you will find all necessary information about the service, including path to the log files.\n\n## Logs\n\nGeneral path for log files is: ` ~/.ros/log/latest/connectivity-worker-1.log` where `connectivity-worker-1.log` is the last recordered file.\n\nFor watching logs in real time:\n```bash\ntail -f  <path>\n```\nWhere path should be replced with the log path. To look through the whole file simply open the log file in your favourite editor.\n\nIt can be useful to copy log files to your local machine:\n\n```bash\nscp -rv <user>@<address>: <path-to-log-files> <path-in-your-local-machine>\n```","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"es/connectivity-terminal-readme.md","name":"connectivity-terminal-readme"}}},"context":{}}
