Robonomics allow designers of smart cities and industry 4.0 zones to build trust among the [autonomous robots services](/docs/glossary#cyber-physical-system), provide [direct user access via dapp](/docs/glossary#dapp) for ordering products from autonomous factories and services of urban sensor networks. This in turn will allow us to put in place a decentralized system that globally monitors the activities of cyber physical systems.\n\nFind more in [Robonomics whitepaper](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics_specs/blob/master/pdf/whitepaper_en.pdf)\n\nThe following chart describes what place Robonomics takes in the scenario:\n\n![Robonomics Chart](../images/robonomics_network_basic_scheme.jpg \"Robonomics Network scenario\")\n\n## What the documentation contains\n\n### Robonomics Network quick start\nStart with quick example of what Robonomics is able to do within 5 minutes: [DEMO \"Get Weather on Fuji Mountain\"](/docs/get-weather-on-fuji-mountain).\n\n### I'm interested in using Robonomics services\n\nTake a look at the [Robonomics Dapp](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/). Get familiar with the statistic, average miner reward etc.\nTry out existing [services](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/services)\n\n### I'm a Dapp developer\n\n- [Robonomics-js on GitHub](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-js) - simple Javascript SDK for Robonomics Network dApp developers.\n- [dApp template](https://github.com/airalab/vue-dapp-robonomics-template) - uses Vue.js\n- [Wiki documentation](/docs/robonomics-js/)\n\n### I'm a robotics engineer\n\nCheck out [cases](/docs/iot-sensors-connectivity/) section and start developing by [examples](/docs/agent-development-examples).\n\n"}},"context":{}}
