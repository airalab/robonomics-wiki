For that open a configuration file on your raspberry pi:\n\n```bash\nnano ~/.homeassistant/configuration.yaml\n```\n\nAnd add following to the end of the file (full config file you can find [here](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/blob/main/configuration.yaml)):\n\n```yaml\nautomation:\n  - alias: \"vacuum_start\"\n    trigger:\n      platform: webhook\n      webhook_id: \"vacuum_start\"\n    action:\n      service: vacuum.start\n      target:\n        entity_id:\n          - vacuum.robot_vacuum\n\n  - alias: \"vacuum_pause\"\n    trigger:\n      platform: webhook\n      webhook_id: \"vacuum_pause\"\n    action:\n      service: vacuum.pause\n      target:\n        entity_id:\n          - vacuum.robot_vacuum\n\n  - alias: \"vacuum_return_to_base\"\n    trigger:\n      platform: webhook\n      webhook_id: \"vacuum_return_to_base\"\n    action:\n      service: vacuum.return_to_base\n      target:\n        entity_id:\n          - vacuum.robot_vacuum\n```\nAnd restart Home Assistant:\n```bash\nsystemctl restart home-sistant@homeassistant.service\n```\n\nNow you can create datalog in your account to command robot to Start Cleaning, to Pause or to Return to Base. The message must be encrypted. you can send encrypted message with [send_datalog.py](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/blob/main/python_scripts/send_datalog.py) script that you used in [Raspberry Setup](/docs/raspberry_setup) page.\nRun the script in a new terminal with message to start cleaning:\n```bash\ncd /srv/homeassistant/python_scripts\nsource /srv/homeassistant/bin/activate\npython3 send_datalog.py \"{ \\\"agent\\\" : \\\"vacuum_start\\\" }\"\n```\nto pause:\n```bash\ncd /srv/homeassistant/python_scripts\nsource /srv/homeassistant/bin/activate\npython3 send_datalog.py \"{ \\\"agent\\\" : \\\"vacuum_pause\\\" }\"\n```\nto return to base:\n```bash\ncd /srv/homeassistant/python_scripts\nsource /srv/homeassistant/bin/activate\npython3 send_datalog.py \"{ \\\"agent\\\" : \\\"vacuum_return_to_base\\\" }\"\n```\n"}},"context":{}}
