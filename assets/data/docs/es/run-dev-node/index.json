This article shows step-by-step\ninstructions how to get your own local testing instance of Robonomics.**\n\n\n## Get Node Binary\n\n1. First, you need a binary file, download the archive with it from the latest [release](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases).\n\n2. Navigate to the archive folder, unpack the binary and change permissions:\n\n```bash\ntar xf robonomics-2.4.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz\nchmod +x robonomics\n```\n\n## Run\n\nRun the node with:\n\n```bash\n./robonomics --dev\n```\nYou will see the following output:\n\n![robonomics](../images/dev-node/robonomics.png)\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\" title=\"From Scratch\">\n\n  If you want to purge existing blocks you may do this with removing RocksDB at `/tmp/substrate******/chains/dev/db/full`.\n  Replace `******` with a corresponding identifier displayed in logs on launch.\n\n  If you want to start the node from scratch every time use `--tmp` flag.\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n## Connect\n\nNow you can connect to your local node through the [Polkadot Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer).\n\nChange the network to `Local Node` in the upper left corner and press `Switch`.\n\n![switch](../images/dev-node/portal.png)\n\nWelcome to the local instance of Robonomics!\n\n![local_node](../images/dev-node/dev-portal.png)\n\n\n","tools":["Robonomics 2.4.0 https://github.com/airalab/robonomics"],"fileInfo":{"path":"es/run-dev-node.md","name":"run-dev-node"}}},"context":{}}
