First, you need a binary file, download the archive with it from the latest [release](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases).\n\n2. Unpack it and change permissions:\n\n```bash\ntar xf robonomics-1.7.0-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz\nchmod +x robonomics\n```\n\n3. And run in the dev mode:\n\n```bash\n./robonomics --dev\n```\nYou will see the following output:\n\n![robonomics](../images/dev-node/robonomics.png)\n\n## Get tokens\n\nNow you can connect to your local node through the [Polkadot Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer).\n\nChange the network to `Local Node` in the upper left corner and press `Switch`.\n\n![local_node](../images/dev-node/portal.png)\n\nThen go to `Accounts`:\n\n![accs](../images/dev-node/accs.png)\n\nYou can create a new account with the button `Add Account`.\n\n![add_acc](../images/dev-node/add_acc.png)\n\nDon't forget to save your seed phrase somewhere.\n\nAnd use one of existing accounts to send tokens to your new one. Choose for example Alice and press `Send`. Then choose your new account and write the amount of units you want to send and press `Make Transfer`:\n\n![send](../images/dev-node/send.png)"}},"context":{}}
