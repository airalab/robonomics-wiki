If you are on this page, \nthis is mean that you complete one variant from \"Install\" section and the \"Home Assistant init\" article.**\n\n\n## Install MQTT broker\n\nThere is a quick installation option with a pre-written script. Connect to your Raspberry Pi, where you host Home Assistant and run:\n\n```shell\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-hass-utils/main/raspberry_pi/mqtt-install.sh\nbash mqtt-install.sh\n```\n\nYou will be asked to insert **USERNAME** and **PASSWORD** for Broker. Now it's running as a `systemd` service.\n\n## Add MQTT Integration\n\nNow, you should install MQTT integration to the Home Assistant. For this on you Home Assistant web interface go to \n`Settings` -> `devices & Services`.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/settings.jpg\" alt=\"settings screen\" />\n\nAnd press `ADD INTEGRATION` at the right bottom corner. In the opened window find `MQTT`:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/mqtt.jpg\" />\n\nPress on it and set up your broker address - `localhost`, port - `1883` \nand your username and password, which you've created earlier, then press `submit`:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/mqtt-setup.jpg\" />\n\nNow it's time to add some devices to your smart home.
