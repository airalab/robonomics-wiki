To install it you can use our bash script or install it manually.\n\n## Install with script\n\nHere is a quick installation option with a pre-written script:\n\n```shell\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LoSk-p/robonomics-hass-utils/main/raspberry_pi/mqtt-install.sh\nbash mqtt-install.sh\n```\n\nYou will be asked to insert **USERNAME** and **PASSWORD** for Broker.\nAfter finishing, you can go to the next part - \"[Home Assistant](#home-assistant)\"\n\n## Manual Installation\n\nAlternatively, you can install the broker directly.\n\nFirst, install [Mosquitto Broker](https://mosquitto.org/):\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update -y && sudo apt install mosquitto mosquitto-clients -y\n```\n\nConfigure username (you can use any username you want) and password (you will be asked to enter the password after the command):\n\n```bash\nsudo mosquitto_passwd -c /etc/mosquitto/passwd <username>\n```\n\nThen edit configuration file:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf\n```\n\nAdd the following at the end of the file:\n\n```\nlistener 1883\nallow_anonymous false\npassword_file /etc/mosquitto/passwd\n```\n\nThen restart the service:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl restart mosquitto\n```\n\nAnd check the Broker status:\n\n```bash\nsystemctl status mosquitto\n```\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/mosquitto.jpg\" alt=\"Broker status\" />\n\n\n<robo-wiki-title :type=\"2\" anchor=\"home-assistant\"> \n  Home Assistant\n</robo-wiki-title>\n\nAlright, you made it here. The tough part is done.\n\nWith Home Assistant installed, it’s time to configure it. Here you will create the owner account of Home Assistant. \nThis account will be an administrator and will always be able to change everything. Open web browser and go to `http://%RASPBERRY_IP_ADDRESS%:8123`(RASPBERRY_IP_ADDRESS you have found in previous [article]()).\n\nAt the first page, enter a name, username, password and click on “create account”.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/username.jpg\" alt=\"create user\" />\n\nNext, you can enter a name for your home and set your location and unit system. Click “DETECT” to find your location and set your time zone and unit system based on that location.\nIf you’d rather not send your location, you can set these values manually.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/location.jpg\" alt=\"set location\" />\n\nOnce you are done, click Next. In this screen, Home Assistant will show any devices that it has discovered on your network.\nDon’t be alarmed if you see fewer items than what is shown below; you can always manually add devices later.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/add-devices.jpg\" alt=\"additional devices\" />\n\nFinally, click Finish. Now you’re brought to the Home Assistant web interface.\nThis screen will show all of your devices. So let’s get that screen filled up!\n\nNow, you should install MQTT client. For this go to `Settings` -> `devices & Services`.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/settings.jpg\" alt=\"settings screen\" />\n\nAnd press `ADD INTEGRATION` at the right bottom corner. In the opened window find `MQTT`:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/mqtt.jpg\" />\n\nPress on it and set up your broker address - `localhost`, port - `1883` \nand your username and password, which you've created earlier, then press `submit`:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/mqtt-setup.jpg\" />\n\nThen press on three dots on MQTT integration and choose `System Options` and check if automatically adding new devices is enabled:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/add-dev.jpg\" />\n\n\nAfter finishing, you can go to the next article:\n\n### Method 1 (with zigbee2MQTT)\n* If you have Zigbee adapter [JetHome USB JetStick Z2](https://jethome.ru/z2/) (or one of [supported](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html)) go [**here.**](/docs/zigbee2-mqtt/)\n\n### Method 2 (with SLS Gateway)\n* If you have [Robonomics SLS Gateway](https://easyeda.com/ludovich88/robonomics_sls_gateway_v01) go [**here.**](/docs/sls-setup/)\n\n","tools":["Mosquitto Broker 2.0.11 https://mosquitto.org/"],"fileInfo":{"path":"en/mqtt-broker.md","name":"mqtt-broker"}}},"context":{}}
