However, if you have another adapter the first thing you need to flash it with zigbee2MQTT software. You can find instructions for your device [here](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html).\n\nNecessary ziqbee2mqtt software has already been installed on the  Raspberry PI on previous steps. \n\nFirst, Connect the adapter to Raspberry PI. Now we need to find the location of our stick. For this type in the next command.:\n\n```bash\n$ ls -l /dev/serial/by-id\n```\n\nOutput should look like:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/devices.jpg\" alt=\"connected devices\" />\n\nIn example Stick connection place is - `ttyUSB0`.\n\nThen you need to configure it. Before starting Zigbee2MQTT we need to edit the configuration.yaml file. This file contains the configuration which will be used by Zigbee2MQTT.:\n\n```bash\nnano /opt/zigbee2mqtt/data/configuration.yaml\n```\n\nBasic configuration needs a few adjustments. Change the following statements:\n - `homeassistant:` to `true`. It will automatically connect sensors to Home Assistant.\n - uncomment `user` and `password`statements under `mqtt` and fill them with your username and password from MQTT Broker.(You created them it in the previous article.)\n - change port in `serial`-> `port` to `/dev/stick_connection_place>`. In example `/dev/ttyUSB0`.\n\nAdjusted configuration file should look like:\n\n```shell\n# Home Assistant integration (MQTT discovery)\nhomeassistant: true\n\n# allow new devices to join\npermit_join: true\n\n# MQTT settings\nmqtt:\n  # MQTT base topic for zigbee2mqtt MQTT messages\n  base_topic: zigbee2mqtt\n  # MQTT server URL\n  server: 'mqtt://localhost'\n  # MQTT server authentication, uncomment if required:\n  user: <YOUR_USERNAME>\n  password: <YOUR_PASSWORD>\n\n# Serial settings\nserial:\n  # Location of CC2531 USB sniffer\n  port: /dev/<YOUR_PORT> # /dev/ttyUSB0 for example\n```\n\nNow you can run zigbee2mqtt:\n\n```bash\ncd /opt/zigbee2mqtt\nnpm start\n```\n\nIf started successfully, you will see something like:\n```shell\nBuilding Zigbee2MQTT...

For lamps one may switch them on|off for 5 times. The zigbee2MQTT should be launched. When a device connects, you should see a message like:\n\n```\nZigbee2MQTT:info  2022-07-29 14:44:39: Successfully interviewed '0x00158d0003eeeacf', device has successfully been paired\n```\nAnd a lot of additional data about this sensor. Remember ID of the sensor - in this example `0x00158d0003eeeacf`.\n\nNow you should see this sensor with ID in your Home Assistant WebUI. Go to `settings` -> `Devices & Services` -> `Devices`:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/mqtt-devices.jpg\" />\n\n\n> After adding all the sensors, you can stop program and open configuration file again to set and set `permit_join: false`, if you don’t want to add any more devices.\n\nThen lets make a service. Create the file:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/systemd/system/zigbee2mqtt.service\n```\n\nAdd the following to this file:\n\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=zigbee2mqtt\nAfter=network.target\n\n[Service]\nExecStart=/usr/bin/npm start\nWorkingDirectory=/opt/zigbee2mqtt\nStandardOutput=inherit\nStandardError=inherit\nRestart=always\nUser=ubuntu\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nVerify that the configuration works:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl start zigbee2mqtt\n```\n\n```bash\nsystemctl status zigbee2mqtt.service\n```\n\nOutput should look like:\n```\npi@raspberry:/opt/zigbee2mqtt $ systemctl status zigbee2mqtt.service\n● zigbee2mqtt.service - zigbee2mqtt\n   Loaded: loaded (/etc/systemd/system/zigbee2mqtt.service; disabled; vendor preset: enabled)\n   Active: active (running) since Thu 2018-06-07 20:27:22 BST; 3s ago\n Main PID: 665 (npm)\n   CGroup: /system.slice/zigbee2mqtt.service\n           ├─665 npm\n           ├─678 sh -c node index.js\n           └─679 node index.js\n\nJun 07 20:27:22 raspberry systemd[1]: Started zigbee2mqtt.\nJun 07 20:27:23 raspberry npm[665]: > zigbee2mqtt@1.6.0 start /opt/zigbee2mqtt\nJun 07 20:27:23 raspberry npm[665]: > node index.js\nJun 07 20:27:24 raspberry npm[665]: Zigbee2MQTT:info  2019-11-09T13:04:01: Logging to directory: '/opt/zigbee2mqtt/data/log/2019-11-09.14-04-01'\nJun 07 20:27:25 raspberry npm[665]: Zigbee2MQTT:info  2019-11-09T13:04:01: Starting Zigbee2MQTT version 1.6.0 (commit #720e393)\n```\n\nNow that everything works, we want systemctl to start Zigbee2MQTT automatically on boot, this can be done by executing:\n\n```bash\nsudo systemctl enable zigbee2mqtt.service\n```\nThat's all.
