Choose `rws` and `auctionQueue` and press `+` button, you will see IDs of available auctions:\n\n![queue](../images/dev-node/queue.png)\n\nYou can see an information about any subscription with `rws` `auction` and ID of auction (the auction's ID in the picture is 0):\n\n![auction](../images/dev-node/auction.png)\n\nIn the information about the auction you can see `winner` field, at the moment it is `null` so nobody has this subscription and we can get it. For that go to `Developer/Extrinsic`, choose your account and `rws -> bid`. Also set auction ID (0) and the amount of units to bid (more than 1000000000 Wn):\n\n![bid](../images/dev-node/bid.png)\n\nSubmit the transaction and check the information about the auction with ID 0 (in `Chain state` choose `rws -> auction` and ID 0):\n\n![win](../images/dev-node/auc_win.png)\n\nNow in `winner` field you will see your account address, it means that this account has the subscription 0. An auction starts with the first bid and lasts a few blocks, so if somebody bids more tokens than you in the next few blocks one will be the winner and one will take the subscription.\n\nNow you can add devices. Devices are accounts that are able to use this subscription and send extrinsics with no fee. To test it lets create a new account with no tokens and add it to devices. \n\nTo add devices choose `rws -> setDevices` in `Developer/Extrinsic`. Then press `Add Item` button and choose recently created account with no tokens:\n\n![set_devices](../images/dev-node/set_devices.png)\n\nSubmit the transaction. Now you can check the list of devices in `Chain state` with `rws -> devices`. There you will see the address of your account without tokens. Choose the account that has bought the subscription and press `+`:\n\n![devices](../images/dev-node/devices.png)\n\nNow you can try to [send launch](/docs/subscription-launch) extrinsic using the subscription.","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"en/get-subscription.md","name":"get-subscription"}}},"context":{}}
