Find the folder with the locale that matches the language of the article you are adding, e.g. `/docs/en/`\n2. Create .md file, using in name latin characters and follow common rules for [url structure](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/url-structure)\n3. Edit file as described above\n4. Duplicate file to other locale folders, even if you do not plan to translate them. Do not forget mark in frontmatter not translated pages as `translated: false`\n5. Add doc in menu:\n* Open file `/data/sidebar_docs.yaml`\n* Decide where to place your doc\n* If you want to create new section, provide title with locale appendix, using only locales your section is translated\n* Add doc with link. The link must be only one, and must not contain locale characters. Correct is `/docs/url-of-your-doc`, not correct is `/docs/en/url-of-your-doc`\n* Use valid YAML for `/data/sidebar_docs.yaml` and rely on the existing file structure\n\n## Submit Pull Request\n\n[Make pull request](https://docs.github.com/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request) for any content you changed including typos, translations, outdated information or broken links.\n\nDecisions about individual PRs made by Robonomics core team.
