Stop the robonomics service\r\n\r\n``systemctl stop robonomics.service``\r\n\r\n2. Remove previous version of Robonomics (make sure you are in the correct directory)\r\n\r\n``rm -f robonomics.X.X.X-ubuntu-x86_64.tar.gz``\r\n\r\n3. Get the latest release version of Robonomics\r\n\r\n``wget https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/vX.X.X/.....``\r\n\r\n4. tar -xf new file\r\n\r\n``tar -xf robonomics-X.X.X-x86_64-unknown-linux.gnu.tar.gz``\r\n\r\n5. Move the file\r\n\r\n``mv robonomics /usr/local/bin/``\r\n\r\n*(note, you need to move this file to the correct directory which you installed the Robonomics node)*\r\n\r\n6. Start Robonomics\r\n\r\n``systemctl start robonomics.service``\r\n\r\n# **Example when upgrading collator node to Robonomics v1.8.4**\r\n\r\n``sudo su -`` - log in to root environment\r\n\r\n``cd /home/admin`` - navigate to the correct directory (your directory may be different)\r\n\r\n``systemctl stop robonomics.service`` - stop Robonomics\r\n\r\n``rm -f robonomics-1.7.3-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`` - remove previous version\r\n\r\n``wget https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/download/v1.8.4/robonomics-1.8.4-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`` - download latest release version (in this example v1.8.3)\r\n\r\n``tar -xf robonomics-1.8.4-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz`` - extract files\r\n\r\n``mv robonomics /usr/local/bin/`` - move files to desired location\r\n\r\n``systemctl start robonomics.service`` start Robonomics service\r\n\r\nNote: releases of Robonomics can be found here: https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases/ \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"context":{}}
