You can do this by following the procedure in [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) website.\n\nIn order to connect to the sensor on top Fuji Mountain, follow the steps below: \n\n## 1. Access  Weather Sensor\n\nTo access the weather sensor, you should first navigate to Robonomics Services webpages from DAPP. \n\n- Go to DAPP [webpage](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/).\n- From left sidebar, under market place section, click [Services](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/services) and choose [\"FUJI WEATHER\"](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/fuji/airalab/QmbQT8cj9TJKfYVaidfShnrEX1g14yTC9bdG1XbcRX73wY/0x4D8a26e1f055c0b28D71cf1deA05f0f595a6975d/)\n![FUJI-SENSOR](../images/connecting-to-fuji-sensor/services-fuji-sensor.jpg \"FUJI-SENSOR\")\n\n\n## 2. Connect to MetaMask Account\nIf you're not connected to your MetaMask account already, you should now get connected to be able to retrieve the sensor data. In order to do that, follow the steps below:\n- Click on \"Connect account\" in the up-right part of the DAPP webpage.\n![FUJI-SENSOR](../images/connecting-to-fuji-sensor/connect-button.jpg \"FUJI-SENSOR\")\n- In the prompted window, choose your account, click \"Next\" and finally press \"Connect\"\n\n<img alt= \"choose-account\" src=\"../images/connecting-to-fuji-sensor/choose-account.jpg\" width=\"325\"/>\n<img alt= \"choose-account\" src=\"../images/connecting-to-fuji-sensor/connect-to-account.jpg\" width=\"325\"/>\n\n## 3. Send Request and Sign\nAfter getting connected to your MetaMask account, click on \"Sign with ethereum account\" and finally sign it in the prompted window. You should receive the sensor data after signing the request.\n\n<p align=\"center\">\n<img alt=\"sign-button\" src=\"../images/connecting-to-fuji-sensor/sign-button.jpg\" width=\"655\"/>\n<img alt= \"sign-prompt\" src=\"../images/connecting-to-fuji-sensor/connect-to-account.jpg\" width=\"325\"/>\n<img alt= \"sensor-data\" src=\"../images/connecting-to-fuji-sensor/sensor-data.jpg\" width=\"325\"/>\n</p>\n\nThe following video further illustrates getting data from weather sensor on top of the Fuji Mountain.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/NOQxyojvaao\n\n- [Reference tutorial on Wiki](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/get-weather-on-fuji-mountain/)\n- [Dapp](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/)"}},"context":{}}
