Brands such as Xiaomi and Aqara work through a proprietary gateway. As a result, you as a user are always dependent\non the hardware and infrastructure vendor to run the entire system.\n\n**We see two main problems with this approach:**\n\n1. Having a single point of failure in the form of vendor clouds\n2. You have no control over what data you share\n\nTo solve the first problem, you can install and configure a local server running software such as \n[Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) or [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/). And to ensure the safe management\nof your smart home from anywhere in the world, the technologies of the [Robonomics](https://robonomics.network/) platform come to the rescue.\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\" title=\"Home Assistant x Robonomics\">\n\n  This project is aimed at both, users who already have an instance of Home Assistant and the ones who are making their\n  first steps in the world of self-controlled smart homes.\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\nIf you already have Home Assistant up and running, you probably have everything you need, but if not, the list of \nrequirements is the following:\n\n* Raspberry Pi 4 or a similar SBC\n* SD card and SD adapter\n* Zigbee smart devices (any from [supported devices](https://slsys.io/action/supported_devices.html))\n* Zigbee adapter [JetHome USB JetStick Z2](https://jethome.ru/z2/) (or one of [supported](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html)) or [Robonomics SLS Gateway](https://easyeda.com/ludovich88/robonomics_sls_gateway_v01)\n\n\n","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"en/home-assistant-begin.md","name":"home-assistant-begin"}}},"context":{}}
