It is the client for Robonomics Network developed by [Airalab](https://aira.life). It is an operating system based on [NixOS](https://nixos.org/). With AIRA you can  turn any cyber-physical system in an economic agent, where robots operate as a services for the reasonable payments. [More theory about AIRA here](/docs/aira-overview).\n\nIt's possible to install AIRA on a x86_64 PC. Also there are images for Raspberry Pi 3 and 4 supported by the team.\n\nThe best way to try AIRA is to start from installing it as a virtual machine on [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).\n\n## Requirements\n\n* VirtualBox\n* [VirtualBox Extension Pack](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads#VirtualBox6.1.2OracleVMVirtualBoxExtensionPack)\n* 2Gb of RAM for the machine\n* 40Gb of free disk space\n\n## Obtain the image\n\nAIRA has [stable](https://aira.life/channels/aira-stable/) and [unstable](https://aira.life/channels/aira-unstable/) channels.\n\nTo get stable image download the file with `.ova` extension.\n\tThe link for stable image is [here](https://releases.aira.life/channels/aira/stable/862-aira-stable/nixos-20.03pre-git-x86_64-linux.ova)\n\nDon't forget to compare checksum of the downloaded image with the last column `SHA-256 hash` on the [download page](https://aira.life/channels/aira-stable/). It must be equal to the output of the following command (it is an example, please check the name of downloaded by you .ova file first):\n\n```\nsha256sum nixos-20.03pre-git-x86_64-linux.ova\n```\n\nYou may wish to check out the walkthrough video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/cDcaypYPBhI\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you have fresh installed VirtualBox, you need to install the [extension](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) pack or disable USB 2.0 controller.\n\nAlso VirtualBox may show a warning about `Display settings`. Consider switching `Graphics Controller` in settings of the VM to `VMSVGA`.\n\n## Import to VirtualBox\n\nOpen VirtualBox and press `Ctrl+I` or go to `File > Import Applicance...`\n\n![AIRA import VB image](../images/aira-installation/aira_import_vb_image.jpg \"AIRA import VB image\")\n\nAt this moment the next step is not necessary but it will help you to connect to the VM via SSH easily.\n\nFirst add `Host-Only` adapter in VirtualBox menu `File > Host Network Manager...` or by pressing `Ctrl+H`\n\n![Host Only](../images/aira-installation/host_only_adapter.jpg \"Host Only\")\n\nThen go to the image's settings, Network and add the second network adapter\n\n![Second adapter](../images/aira-installation/add_second_adapter.jpg \"Second adapter\")\n\nFor more details look at the standalone [lesson](/docs/aira-connecting-via-ssh/).\n\nOptionally you can increase the amount of video memory and switch `Graphics Controller` to `VMSVGA`.\n\n## Launch the machine\n\nFinally press Start and you'll see AIRA welcoming you with generated Ethereum address and IPFS identifier\n\n![AIRA image ready, Welcome screen](../images/aira-installation/aira_image_ready.jpg \"AIRA image ready, Welcome screen\")\n\nAt the very first initialization AIRA generates new Ethereum address and IPNS identifier for you.\n\n"}},"context":{}}
