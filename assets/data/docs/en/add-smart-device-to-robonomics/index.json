Integration allow Home Assistant to record datalogs with encrypted data from Home Assistant and listen launch commands to control smart devices. Integration use IPFS to store data and send IPFS hash in datalog or launch.\n\n## Configure\n\nNow you can add integration to Home Assistant. In web interface go to `Settings/Device & Services` and press `Add Integration`. Find there `Robonomics`:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/add-integration.jpg\" />\n\nClick on it and fill the configuration. Here you need to add seed from `SUB_ADMIN` and public address of `SUB_OWNER` accounts (which you've just created).\n Also you can set sending interval, by default it is 10 minutes.\n\nMoreover, you can add your Pinata credentials. It is not necessary, if you will not do it, data will be pinned with your local node and Infura. If you add it, files also will be pinned in Pinata, it may help to faster access it.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/config.jpg\" />\n\n Fill in everything and press `Submit`. If everything correct, you will see **Success** window. Close it.\n\n## Use DApp\n\nNow it's time to create the first user for your Home Assistant.(It's shouldn't be `SUB_OWNER` or `SUB_ADMIN` accounts). Create account, as we did in previous [article](/docs/iot-sub-setup/). \nAdd this account to subscription [here](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/subscription/devices). Now in access list should be three addresses - `SUB_OWNER`, `SUB_ADMIN` and `user`.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/user.jpg\" />\n\nThen go to our Dapp to service [**\"HomeAssistant Account\"**](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/home-assistant). Choose account, you've just created at the right sidebar.(You can find it address in extension).\nIn next two raws insert `SUB_OWNER` and `SUB_ADMIN` addresses. Then write `USER` seed:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/acc-pass.jpg\" />\n\nCreate password for Home Assistant in **Enter Password** field. And Press `REGISTRATON`. Confirm transaction. After finishing of registration process, you can login to Home Assistant with your address as `login` and just created password. Go to login page and login:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/acc-login.jpg\" />\n\nNow you can use `SmartHome Telemetry` DApp to control your home through the Robonomics.
