This module allows any user to raise his own server to receive data from sensors and process it further. Now the developers have launched several such servers and any sensor can send data to them. Running several servers allows to avoid data loss in case of problems with one of them, because sensors from a non-working server will switch to a working one.\n\nSensors Connectivity schematic:\n\n```\n    station1 \\                        / feeder1\n    station2 -  sensors-connectivity  - feeder2\n    station3 /                        \\ feeder3\n```\n\nSensors Connectivity is a set of stations (station1, station2...), which receive various data, including data from sensors via http protocol. But also it can be sensors connected to the computer via USB or any other data source.\n\nData received from the stations are processed by Sensors Connectivity and passed to feeders (feeder1, feeder2...). Feeders send the processed data to the user. In our case the data is sent to the decentralized IPFS channel.\n\nMap [sensors.robonomics.network](https://sensors.robonomics.network/) is a decentralized application (DApp) running on your computer. It reads data from the IPFS channel and outputs them to the map. So there is no direct connection between the server collecting the data from the sensors and the map the user sees, the data transfer between them is done via IPFS pubsub, which reduces the load on the servers.\n\nIn addition, every once in a while, a file with data from the last time period is saved in IPFS, and the hash of that data is further written to the blockchain. Since IPFS is a content-addressable network, storing data in it guarantees that any change in the data will not go unnoticed, because the address of the desired file contains a hash of its content, which will change if any change in the data occurs. The blockchain is used to pass the hash on to the user, who can use it to retrieve the desired data from the IPFS (which is what happens when requesting to view the history on [sensors.robonomics.network](https://sensors.robonomics.network/)). Since the transaction made cannot be changed, we can be sure that it is the correct hash.\n\nThe source code for Sensors Connectivity is available at [link](https://github.com/airalab/sensors-connectivity). To see the data from your server on the map, you need to contact the development team at vm@multi-agent.io and send the ipfs id of your server. \n\n\n## Pre-requirements\n\nTo build a python package IPFS daemon should be installed. Assyming, you work with linux:\n\n```\nwget https://dist.ipfs.io/go-ipfs/v0.8.0/go-ipfs_v0.8.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz\ntar -xzf go-ipfs_v0.8.0_linux-amd64.tar.gz\ncd go-ipfs\nsudo bash install.sh \nipfs init\n```\nYou can get IPFS ID with the following command after running IPFS daemon (it is in the `ID` column):\n\n```console\n$ ipfs id\n{\n\t\"ID\": \"QmUZxw8jsRpSx5rWkTpJokPGKvWihTrt5rbRCFXzJ4eCAP\",\n\t\"PublicKey\": \"CAASpgIwggEiMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBAQUAA4IBDwAwggEKAoIBAQC/uMV3rLM/C+LOh2DGPo3chr+VM+vyYMKi...\n    ...\n```\n\n## Installation as PyPi package\n\n```\npip3 install py-sr25519-bindings\npip3 install sensors-connectivity\n```\n\n### Configuration\n\n[Here](/docs/configuration-options-description/) you can find an article to set a proper configuration for your instance.\n\n### Running\n\nFirst, launch IPFS daemon:\n\n```\nipfs daemon --enable-pubsub-experiment\n```\nAfter config is set, you can run the service: (in another terminal)\n\n```\nsensors_connectivity \"path/to/your/config/file\"\n```\n\nYou will be able to see logs in your console and in `~/.logs`.\n\n## Build from source\n### Requirements\n\nTo build a python package fron source [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#osx--linux--bashonwindows-install-instructions) should be also installed. Assyming, you work with linux:\n\n```\ncurl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -\n```\n\n### Get a Package And Installing dependencies\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/airalab/sensors-connectivity\ncd sensors-connectivity\npoetry install\n```\n\n### Documentation\n\nTo prepare a sensor for the work with the package follow instructions on [Robonomics Wiki](/docs/connect-sensor-to-robonomics/).\n\n### Configuration\n\n[Here](/docs/configuration-options-description/) you can find an article to set a proper configuration for your instance.\n\nMake a copy of `default.json` and fill it using description from the article.\n\nYou also can set a logging file. The default file for logs is `logging.py`, which uses `console` and `file` handler by default. Pay attention for the `file` handler. The template is stored in `connectivity/config/logging_template.py`. You can cpecify the path (`filename`), where your logs will be stored in (do not forget to create this directory if it doesn't exist). Default path for logs is `~/.logs`. You can figure any other handlers from the [library](https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/logging.html).\n\n### Running\n\nFirst, launch IPFS daemon:\n\n```\nipfs daemon --enable-pubsub-experiment\n```\nAfter config and log files are setted, you can run the service: (in another terminal)\n\n```\npoetry run sensors_connectivity \"path/to/your/config/file\"  \n```\n\nIf your log file is setted with `console` handler, you will be able to see logs in your console.\n\n### Example of logs:\n\n```\n2022-02-17 19:30:51,248 - INFO - Getting data from the stations...\n2022-02-17 19:30:51,443 - INFO - airalab-http-v0.8.0: [[], [{MAC: c8e2650f254e, Uptime: 0:00:14.010502, M: {Public: 0be87b58e87599a85dc79bf14731cc9ad547411e9b10c883e29f78fc2c67206a, geo: (53.518475,49.397178000000004), measurements: {'airtemp': -8.0, 'windang': 45.0, 'windspeed': 0.13, 'windspeedmax': 0.13, 'pm10': '', 'pm25': '', 'timestamp': 1645113602.0}}}]]\n2022-02-17 19:30:51,443 - INFO - Sending result to the feeders...\n2022-02-17 19:31:07,517 - INFO - Frontier Datalog: Data sent to Robonomics datalog and included in block 0x04baf3d81c6d31ec6f3ca3e515b9a6920666ee17cbd66f57130eaa000bad2cd4\n2022-02-17 19:31:07,519 - INFO - RobonomicsFeeder: {\"0be87b58e87599a85dc79bf14731cc9ad547411e9b10c883e29f78fc2c67206a\": {\"model\": 2, \"geo\": \"53.518475,49.397178000000004\", \"measurement\": {\"airtemp\": -8.0, \"windang\": 45.0, \"windspeed\": 0.13, \"windspeedmax\": 0.13, \"pm10\": \"\", \"pm25\": \"\", \"timestamp\": 1645113602.0}}}\n2022-02-17 19:31:07,523 - INFO - Checking data base...\n127.0.0.1 - - [17/Feb/2022 19:31:13] \"POST / HTTP/1.1\" 200 -\n2022-02-17 19:31:21,248 - INFO - Getting data from the stations...\n2022-02-17 19:31:21,429 - INFO - airalab-http-v0.8.0: [[{MAC: c8e2650f254e, Uptime: 0:00:43.818101, M: {Public: 133b761496539ab5d1140e94f644e2ef92c7ac32446dc782bfe1a768379a669a, geo: (1,200), measurements: {'pm10': 27.58, 'pm25': 15.02, 'temperature': 22.93, 'pressure': 758.0687068706872, 'humidity': 39.44, 'timestamp': 1645115473}}}], [{MAC: c8e2650f254e, Uptime: 0:00:43.996539, M: {Public: 0be87b58e87599a85dc79bf14731cc9ad547411e9b10c883e29f78fc2c67206a, geo: (53.518475,49.397178000000004), measurements: {'airtemp': -8.0, 'windang': 45.0, 'windspeed': 0.13, 'windspeedmax': 0.13, 'pm10': '', 'pm25': '', 'timestamp': 1645113602.0}}}]]\n2022-02-17 19:31:21,444 - INFO - Sending result to the feeders...\n2022-02-17 19:31:51,249 - INFO - Getting data from the stations...\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### Python.h: No such file or directory\n\nIf during running `poetry install` comand you get such error, you need to install the header files and static libraries for python dev. Use your package manager for installation. For example, for `apt` you need to run\n```\nsudo apt install python3-dev\n```\n> Note:\npython3-dev does not cover all versions for python3. The service needs at least python3.8, for that you may need to specify the version `sudo apt install python3.8-dev`.\n\n[Here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/21530768) you can find examples for other package managers.\n\n### Python versions mismatch\n\nIf during running `poetry install` comand you get `SolverProblemError`, which says \"The current project's Python requirement (3.6.9) is not compatible with some of the required packages Python requirement:..\", even though you have older version of python (e.g. python3.8), you may need to specify the python version poetry is using:\n\n```\npoetry env use python3.8\n```\n\n","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"en/sensors-connectivity-on-aira.md","name":"sensors-connectivity-on-aira"}}},"context":{}}
