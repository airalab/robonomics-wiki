You have no control over what data you share with the vendor or third party.\n2. You have a single point of failure in the form of centralized vendor cloud servers.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/ha-problems.png\" />\n\nTo solve both problems, we suggest you to try Robonomics, our **secure**, **serverless** and **futuristic** decentralized cloud.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/ha-robonomics.png\" />\n\nTo prepare a smart home, you will need:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/devices-req.png\" />\n\n* Home Assistant as control system software\n* Raspberry Pi 4 (at least 2 GB RAM)\n* SD card (minimum 16 GB) and SD adapter\n* Zigbee smart devices (any from [supported devices](https://slsys.io/action/supported_devices.html))\n* Zigbee adapter [JetHome USB JetStick Z2](https://jethome.ru/z2/) (or one of [supported](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html)) or [Robonomics SLS Gateway](https://easyeda.com/ludovich88/robonomics_sls_gateway_v01).\n","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"en/robonomics-smart-home-overview.md","name":"robonomics-smart-home-overview"}}},"context":{}}
