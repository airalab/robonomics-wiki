[Here](/docs/carbon-footprint-sensor) is the unstructions for connecting device.\n\n## Scenario\n\n1. Register a new deivce in Digital Twin in Robonomics network \n2. Once in an interval getting last data from all device and multiply by the coefficient depending on the region\n3. Sum data and convert them to CO2 tons\n4. Subtract the total number of burning tokens from current data \n5. Burn integer number of tokens in Statemine network \n6.
