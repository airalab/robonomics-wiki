You can find the IP address of Raspberry Pi \nusing [Fing mobile app](https://www.fing.com/products) or [nmap CLI tool](https://vitux.com/find-devices-connected-to-your-network-with-nmap/). If you set up everything on your PC use `http://localhost:8099`.\n\nYou will see web-interface of Zigbee2MQTT:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/z2m-webinterface.jpg\" />\n\n\n\n\nIt's time to connect your smart device. \nFirst, press `Permit join (All)` button at the top of web-interface of Zigbee2MQTT. \n\nThen, start to pair devices. The most common way to switch a device to connect mode is to hold its power button or switch them on/off 5 times. Make sure Zigbee2MQTT is running.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/switch-device.gif\" />\n\nWhen the device connects, you will see them in web-interface:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/device_connected.jpg\" />\n\nNow you should see this sensor in your Home Assistant WebUI. Go to `Settings` -> `Devices & Services` -> `Devices`.\n\nAfter adding all the sensors, you can close web-interface of Zigbee2MQTT.\n","tools":["Zigbee2MQTT 1.37.1 https://github.com/Koenkk/zigbee2mqtt/"],"fileInfo":{"path":"zigbee-devices.md","name":"zigbee-devices"}}},"context":{}}
