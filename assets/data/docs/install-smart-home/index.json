Home Assistant is an open-source home automation system that provides \na centralized hub for controlling smart devices in your home network. By integrating with Robonomics, a decentralized cloud service, you can enhance the functionality and\nsecurity of your smart home. In this article, we will provide step-by-step instructions on how to install Home Assistant with Robonomics, giving you the ability to \nautomate and control various aspects of your home using a secure and decentralized solution. Let's get started!**\n\n## Hardware you need for installation\n\nIf you haven't already incorporated Home Assistant into your smart home setup, it's important to be aware of the equipment you'll need to establish a complete smart home \nsystem from the ground up. The Robonomics team recommend to use Raspberry Pi 4 as smart home server. **But it's possible to set up everything on your PC.**\n\n  <robo-wiki-grid-element-wrapper textAlign=\"center\" :columns=\"3\" flexible>\n    <robo-wiki-grid-element>\n      <robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/need_2.png\" /> \n      <b>Raspberry Pi 4 (at least 2 GB RAM)</b>\n    </robo-wiki-grid-element>\n    <robo-wiki-grid-element>\n      <robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/need_3.png\" /> \n      <b>SD card 16Gb+</b>\n    </robo-wiki-grid-element>\n    <robo-wiki-grid-element>\n      <robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/need_7.png\" /> \n      <a href=\"https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Zigbee adapter(Optionally)</b></a>\n    </robo-wiki-grid-element>\n  </robo-wiki-grid-element-wrapper>\n\n  <robo-wiki-grid-element-wrapper textAlign=\"center\" :columns=\"2\">\n    <robo-wiki-grid-element>\n      <robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/need_5.png\" />\n      <a href=\"https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/supported-devices/\" target=\"_blank\"><b>Zigbee smart devices(Optionally)</b></a>\n    </robo-wiki-grid-element>\n    <robo-wiki-grid-element>\n      <robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/need_9.png\" />\n      <b>Desktop for setup</b>\n    </robo-wiki-grid-element>\n  </robo-wiki-grid-element-wrapper>\n\n\n## 1. Install Pre-requirements\n\nRobonomics Docker contains:\n- Home Assistant\n- IPFS\n- MQTT Broker and Integration\n- Zigbee2MQTT\n- libp2p proxy\n- Robonomics Integration\n\nThis article will show the installation process on Ubuntu system. First you need to install next packages:\n\n<code-helper copy>\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install wget unzip git\n```\n</code-helper>\n\nThen you need to install Docker on PC. Installation instruction find on [the official website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"warning\" title=\"Important information\">\n\n  Add your user to docker group, to start docker containers without root permissions. Find [instruction here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/).\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n## 2. Configure\n\nDownload the GitHub repository and navigate inside it:\n\n<code-helper copy>\n\n```\nhttps://github.com/PinoutLTD/home-assistant-web3-build.git\ncd home-assistant-web3-build/\n```\n</code-helper>\n\nThen, create a `.env` file from the `template.env`:\n\n<code-helper copy>\n\n```\nmv template.env .env\n```\n\n</code-helper>\n\nAfter that, you may open the `.env` file and edit default values such as:  \n- Versions of packages\n- path to repository where will be stored all configurations folders.\n- time zone in [\"tz database name\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones).\n\n## 3. Start \n\nRun the bash script and wait until it installs all required packages:\n\n<code-helper copy>\n\n```\nbash setup.sh\n```\n\n</code-helper>\nThe script will check all required actions that you completed in the previous steps and will throw an error if something is wrong.\n\nDuring the installation process the following situations may occur:\n- If you decide not to use the Zigbee coordinator, you will see a dialog line confirming whether to continue the installation:\n\n<code-helper>\n\n```\nthis script will create all necessary repositories and start docker containers\nCannot find zigbee coordinator location. Please insert it and run script again. The directory /dev/serial/by-id/ does not exist\nDo you want to continue without zigbee coordinator? It will not start Zigbee2MQTT container.\nDo you want to proceed? (y/n) \n```\n\n</code-helper>\n\n- If there are several devices on your PC that use serial ports, the script will ask which device to use:\n\n<code-helper>\n\n```\nthis script will create all necessary repositories and start docker containers\nthe zigbee coordinator is installed\nYou have more that 1 connected devices. Please choose one\n1) /dev/serial/by-id/usb-ITEAD_SONOFF_Zigbee_3.0_USB_Dongle_Plus_V2_20240123142833-if00\n2) /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Silicon_Labs_Sonoff_Zigbee_3.0_USB_Dongle_Plus_0001-if00-port0\n#? \n```\n\n</code-helper>\n\nThat's all.
