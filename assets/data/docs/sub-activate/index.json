For one of the accounts (`SUB_OWNER`), you will buy a Robonomics subscription. Second account (`SUB_CONTROLLER`) will control all Home Assistant processes (such as telemetry) and will give access to other users. These accounts will provide security for your Home Assistant. \n\nBoth accounts must be created with **ed25519** encryption. \n\n## Create Owner and Controller Accounts\n\nGo to [Robonomics Parachain app](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fkusama.rpc.robonomics.network%2F#/) on Polkadot / Substrate Portal. **Check the top left corner to ensure that you are connected to Robonomics Parachain.**\n\nGo to `Accounts` -> `Accounts` and press `Add account` button. \n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/add-account.jpg\" />\n\nYou should see the following popup menu with account seed:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/mnemonic.jpg\" />\n\nIt has two forms: *Mnemonic* (human-readable) and *Raw* (a sequence of digits and letters). Save the mnemonic seed phrase securely and press `Next`.\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"warning\">\n\nOpen `Advanced creation options`, change the crypto type of creating account to `Edwards - ed25519` and press `Next`.\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/edw.jpg\" />\n\nIn the next menu, you need to set the account name and password. Give it a name SUB_OWNER for convenience.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/name.jpg\" />\n\nClicking on the `Next` button will take you to the last window. Click `Save` to finish account creation. It will also generate a backup JSON-files that you should safely store. You can later use this file to recover your account if you remember the password.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/done.jpg\" />\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"warning\">\n\nRepeat these steps for an account with the name `SUB_CONTROLLER`.\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n## Add Accounts to Polkadot.js\n\nFor convenience, you should use the [Polkadot.js extension](https://polkadot.js.org/extension/) and add these newly created accounts to it. For an ed25519 account you can do that only with a backup JSON file. You can use the files saved when you created the accounts.\n\nYou can get these files again by creating a backup file of the account. Press on three dots on your account, choose `Create a backup file for this account` and type in your password.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"creating-an-account/backup-file.jpg\" />\n\nOpen an extension and press `+` button on the top right, then choose `Restore account from backup JSON file`.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"creating-an-account/extention-add-backup.jpg\" />\n\nIn an opened window upload the JSON file, enter the password and press `Restore`.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"creating-an-account/file-backup.jpg\" />\n\n## Activate Robonomics Subscription \n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"okay\">\n\nFor this step, you must have a sufficient amount of XRT tokens (minimum 2-3 XRTs) in your `SUB_OWNER` account.\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\nGo to Robonomics dapp to the [subscription page](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/subscription) and press connect account on the right sidebar.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/dapp.jpg\" />\n\nIn the following popup menu connect Polkadot.js extension. You will see your account address with balance.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/connect.jpg\" />\n\nBefore purchasing, check that you chose the `SUB_OWNER` account. Press the address profile icon, you should see the `SUB_OWNER` account under the `Check owner account` field.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/check.jpg\" />\n\nFinally, press the `SUBMIT` button and enter the password for your account. After that wait until the activation process is completed. You will see the state of your subscription after a while.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/subscription.jpg\" />\n\n## Add Accounts to Subscription\n\nYou need to add a `SUB_CONTROLLER` account to the **access list**. Open extension and click on the icon near the account name. It will copy the account address.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/sub-admin.jpg\" />\n\nPaste this address to the `Robonomics parachain address` field in the **Manage access** part.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/access.jpg\" />\n\nGive it a name and press the `+` button. Enter your `SUB_OWNER` password in the popup window and wait until the activation process is completed.\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\">\n\nRepeat these steps for `SUB_OWNER` account.\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\nAfter that, go to the article [\"Robonomics Integration Setup\"](/docs/robonomics-hass-integration/) article.","tools":["Robonomics 2.6.0 https://github.com/airalab/robonomics","Dapp Robonomics Network https://github.com/airalab/dapp.robonomics.network"],"fileInfo":{"path":"sub-activate.md","name":"sub-activate"}}},"context":{}}
