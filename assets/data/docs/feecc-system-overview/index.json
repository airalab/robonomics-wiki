Information is\nstored in an unchanged and secure distributed IPFS storage, data hashes are saved in the Robonomics network datalog with\naccess for the quality control department via Feecc Analytics. With Feecc, a company can not only digitize its processes\nand get rid of paperwork and lawsuits, but also attract the attention of new customers to the product, increasing trust\nin it.\n\nThe platform is a set of software for controlling the production process and collecting information for subsequent\nanalysis by the QCD or other participants. Globally, the scheme of platform integration into the business process can be\nrepresented as follows:\n![business_schema](/docs/images/feecc-system-overview/business_schema_eng.jpg)\n\n## Platform Opportunities\n\n### Reliable and secure data storage\n\nFeecc uses a secure data storage based on a content-addressable architecture and a distributed registry to ensure the\nreliability and validity of collected workflow data.\n\n### A clear link between the employee and the product\n\nFeecc monitors all phases of the workflow with video recording, data logging from peripheral devices and employee access\nauthorization. The platform supports any sequential workflow, including long-term or interrupted operations.\n\n### Digital product certificate\n\nAll digital traces of the workflow are summarized in a single product certificate with a unique identifier which is then\nattached as a QR code to the product. Feecc can add custom process parameters to the certificate and automate its\ncreation even for composite parts.\n\n### Extensive support for peripheral devices\n\nFeecc supports standard digital I/O interfaces for connecting various devices (video cameras, scanners, printers, etc.).\n\n## Video Demonstration of the Feecc Engineer Workplace\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WhtOJtGjAok","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"feecc-system-overview.md","name":"feecc-system-overview"}}},"context":{}}
