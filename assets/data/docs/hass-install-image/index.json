It contains Home Assistant Core with Robonomics integration and IPFS. Options for downloading:\n\n### GitHub Release\n\nDownload it from the latest [GitHub releases.](https://github.com/airalab/Robonomics-HomeAssistant-image)\n\n### Image from IPFS\n\nAlternatively, you can download it using IPFS. [Install IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/), initialize and start the daemon:\n\n```shell\nipfs init\nipfs daemon\n```\n\nOpen the new terminal and download the image:\n\n```shell\nipfs get QmcvqPiFVdR436wxqcKyR98uxsMYU2jmfo1K1PX9kfj3Df -o rpi.img.xz\n```\n\n## Configure Image\n\nInstall [balenaEtcher](https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases) on your computer. Then, insert the SD card.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/insert-sd-card.gif\" alt=\"insert SD card\" />\n\nRun the balenaEtcher program. Choose required image as the operating system, ensure to select your SD card from the storage dropdown menu, and then `Flash!` image.\n\n<robo-wiki-video src=\"https://static.robonomics.network/wiki/balena-robonomics-image-crop.mp4\" />\n\n## First Boot\n\nAfter flashing, open the SD card's storage and navigate to the `boot` folder on the card. Create and open a `wpa_supplicant.conf` file:\n```shell\ncd /media/$USER/boot\nnano wpa_supplicant.conf\n```\n\nPaste the following to the file:\n```shell\nctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev\nupdate_config=1\ncountry=<Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here>\n\nnetwork={\n        scan_ssid=1\n        ssid=\"<Name of your wireless LAN>\"\n        psk=\"<Password for your wireless LAN>\"\n        proto=RSN\n        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK\n        pairwise=CCMP\n        auth_alg=OPEN\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to set your Wi-Fi credentials for `ssid`, `psk` fields and set a `country` filed according to your country. You can find country codes [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes). \n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\">\n  \n  This way of setting Wi-Fi credentials is only available before the first boot. If you need to change it later, please, use `sudo raspi-config` command. \n  \n</robo-wiki-note>\n\nThen save the file, **safely eject the SD card**, insert it into the Raspberry Pi and connect the power cable to your device. It should connect to your Wi-Fi network. \n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/first-start.gif\" alt=\"first boot\" />\n\nOnce your Raspberry Pi is connected, the red LED will light up and the green LED will flash for some time. Wait up to 5 minutes for the Raspberry Pi to boot up and register on the network. \n\nNow find the IP address of Raspberry Pi. To find it you can use [Fing mobile app](https://www.fing.com/products) or [nmap CLI tool](https://vitux.com/find-devices-connected-to-your-network-with-nmap/). In this example the the address is `192.168.43.56`.\n\nConnect to it with `ssh` command: \n\n```bash\nssh ubuntu@192.168.43.56\n```\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\"> User is `ubuntu`, password is `ubuntu`. </robo-wiki-note>\n\nNow you have a Raspberry Pi with firmware installed, go to the [Home Assistant Init](/docs/hass-init/) article.","tools":["Home Assistant 2022.11.3 https://github.com/home-assistant/core","Robonomics integration 1.1.3 https://github.com/airalab/homeassistant-robonomics-integration","robonomics-interface 1.3.6 https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/robonomics-interface/","IPFS 0.14.0 https://docs.ipfs.tech/"],"fileInfo":{"path":"hass-install-image.md","name":"hass-install-image"}}},"context":{}}
