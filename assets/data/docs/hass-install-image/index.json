It contains Home Assistant\nCore with Robonomics integration and IPFS.\n\nYou can download it [from GitHub releases.](https://github.com/airalab/Robonomics-HomeAssistant-image)\n\nAlternatively, to download it, IPFS is to be used. [Install IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/) and start the daemon \n(Don't forget to run `ipfs init` before the first start):\n\n```shell\nipfs daemon\n```\n\nIn other terminal download image with\n\n```shell\nipfs get QmcvqPiFVdR436wxqcKyR98uxsMYU2jmfo1K1PX9kfj3Df -o rpi.img.xz\n```\n\nProceed to the next chapter to install the image.\n\n## Configure Image\n\nInstall [balena etcher](https://github.com/balena-io/etcher/releases) on your computer. Then, insert the SD card.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/insert-sd-card.gif\" alt=\"insert sd card\" />\n\nRun the Imager program. Select required image as the operating system and ensure to select your SD card from the storage dropdown, and then `flash` image.\n\n<robo-wiki-video src=\"https://static.robonomics.network/wiki/balena-robonomics-image-crop.mp4\" />\n\n<!-- <robo-wiki-video :local=\"true\" src=\"balena-robonomics-image-crop.mp4\" /> -->\n\n## First Boot\n\nAfter flashing, open the SD card's storage and navigate inside the `boot` folder of the card. Create and open a `wpa_supplicant.conf` file:\n```shell\ncd /media/$USER/boot\nnano wpa_supplicant.conf\n```\n\nPaste the following to the file:\n```shell\nctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev\nupdate_config=1\ncountry=<Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here>\n\nnetwork={\n        scan_ssid=1\n        ssid=\"<Name of your wireless LAN>\"\n        psk=\"<Password for your wireless LAN>\"\n        proto=RSN\n        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK\n        pairwise=CCMP\n        auth_alg=OPEN\n}\n```\nAnd set `ssid`, `psk` and `country` code according to yours. You can find country codes [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes). \n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"warning\">\n  Make sure that you input your actual Wi-Fi name and your Wi-Fi password.\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\"> This way of setting Wi-Fi credentials is only available before the first boot. If you need to change it later, please, use `sudo raspi-config` command. \n</robo-wiki-note>\n\nThen you need to save the file, **safely eject the SD card**, and insert it into the Raspberry Pi and turn it on. It should connect to your wi-fi network. \n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/first-start.gif\" alt=\"first start\" />\n\nAfter your Raspberry Pi is plugged in, red led will be on and green led will blink for some time. \nWait up to 5 minutes for the Raspberry Pi to boot up and register on the network. \n\nNow find the Raspberry Pi's IP address. To find address you can use [Fing mobile app](https://www.fing.com/products)\nor [nmap CLI tool](https://vitux.com/find-devices-connected-to-your-network-with-nmap/).  In this example the Raspberry Pi's address is `192.168.43.56`.\nConnect to it over `ssh`:\n\n```bash\nssh ubuntu@192.168.43.56\n```\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\"> User is \"ubuntu\". Password is \"ubuntu\". </robo-wiki-note>\n\n\nNow that you have a Raspberry Pi with installed firmware, proceed to the [Home Assistant Init](/docs/hass-init/)\npage.","tools":["Home Assistant 2022.11.3 https://github.com/home-assistant/core","Robonomics integration 1.1.3 https://github.com/airalab/homeassistant-robonomics-integration","robonomics-interface 1.3.6 https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/robonomics-interface/","IPFS 0.14.0 https://docs.ipfs.tech/"],"fileInfo":{"path":"hass-install-image.md","name":"hass-install-image"}}},"context":{}}
