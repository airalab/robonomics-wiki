Running several servers allows to avoid data loss in case of problems with one of them,\nas sensors will switch from a non-working server will switch to a working one.\n\nSensors Connectivity module architecture:\n\n```\n    station1 \\                        / feeder1\n    station2 -  sensors-connectivity  - feeder2\n    station3 /                        \\ feeder3\n```\n\nSensors Connectivity module is a set of stations (station1, station2...), which receive various data, including data from sensors via http protocol. But also it can be sensors connected to the computer via USB or any other data source.\n\nData received from the stations are processed by Sensors Connectivity module and passed to feeders (feeder1, feeder2...). The feeders send the processed data to the user. In our case the data is sent to the decentralized IPFS channel.\n\nMap [sensors.robonomics.network](https://sensors.robonomics.network/) is a decentralized application (DApp) running on your computer. It reads data from the IPFS channel and displays it on the map. \nSo there is no direct connection between server collecting the data from sensors and the map the user sees, the data transfer between them is done via IPFS pubsub, which reduces the load on the servers.\n\nIn addition, every once in a while, a file with the data for the last period of time is saved in IPFS, and the hash of that data is further written to the blockchain. \nSince IPFS is a content-addressable network, storing data in it guarantees that any change in the data will not go unnoticed, because the address of the desired file contains a hash of its content, \nwhich will change if any change in the data occurs. The blockchain is used to pass the hash to the user, who can use it to retrieve the desired data from the IPFS (which is what happens when requesting to view the history on [sensors.robonomics.network](https://sensors.robonomics.network/)). Since the transaction made cannot be changed, we can be sure that it is the correct hash.\n\nThe source code for Sensors Connectivity is available at [link](https://github.com/airalab/sensors-connectivity). \n\n","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"sensors-connectivity-on-aira.md","name":"sensors-connectivity-on-aira"}}},"context":{}}
