This account is an administrator and can make any changes. Open web browser and go to `http://%RASPBERRY_IP_ADDRESS%:8123`. You can find the IP address of Raspberry Pi using [Fing mobile app](https://www.fing.com/products) or [nmap CLI tool](https://vitux.com/find-devices-connected-to-your-network-with-nmap/).\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\">Raspberry Pi address may change in time, due router settings.</robo-wiki-note>\n\nAt the first page, enter a name, username, password and click on the `CREATE ACCOUNT` buttoon.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/username.jpg\" alt=\"create user\" />\n\nNext, enter a name for your home and set your location and unit system. Click `DETECT` to find your location and set your time zone and unit system based on that location. If you’d rather not send your location, you can set these values manually.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/location.jpg\" alt=\"set location\" />\n\nOn the next screen, Home Assistant will show any devices that it has discovered on your network. Don’t worry if you see fewer items than what is shown below; you can always manually add devices later. For now, just click `FINISH` and you will be on the main Home Assistant screen.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/add-devices.jpg\" alt=\"additional devices\" />\n\nAfter that, you will see the Home Assistant web interface, which will show all of your devices. Next you need to setup MQTT, so go to the [corresponding article](/docs/mqtt-setup).","tools":["Home Assistant 2022.11.3 https://github.com/home-assistant/core"],"fileInfo":{"path":"hass-init.md","name":"hass-init"}}},"context":{}}
