In the `robot` field type the address you want to send `launch` transaction \nto and insert the command (for launch command description refer [here](/docs/launch)). Then submit transaction:\n\n![launch](./images/rws/launch.png)\n\n\nNow go to the `Network/Explorer` page, and in the `Recent Events` area you will see two events that you created; `rws.NewCall` and `launch.NewLaunch`:\n\n![events](./images/rws/events.png)\n","tools":["Robonomics 2.4.0 https://github.com/airalab/robonomics"],"fileInfo":{"path":"subscription-launch.md","name":"subscription-launch"}}},"context":{}}
