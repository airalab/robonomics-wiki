To do so, you first need a MQTT broker to be set up and MQTT integration to be configured.**\n\n\n## Install MQTT broker\n\nThere is a quick installation option with a pre-written script. Connect to your Raspberry Pi, where you host Home Assistant and run:\n\n```shell\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-hass-utils/main/raspberry_pi/mqtt-install.sh\nbash mqtt-install.sh\n```\n\nYou will be asked to insert **USERNAME** and **PASSWORD** for Broker. Now it's running as a `systemd` service.\n\n## Add MQTT Integration\n\nNow, you should install MQTT integration to the Home Assistant. For this on you Home Assistant web interface go to \n`Settings` -> `devices & Services`.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/settings.jpg\" alt=\"settings screen\" />\n\nAnd press `ADD INTEGRATION` at the right bottom corner. In the opened window find `MQTT`:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/mqtt.jpg\" />\n\nPress on it and set up your broker address - `localhost`, port - `1883` \nand your username and password, which you've created earlier, then press `submit`:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/mqtt-setup.jpg\" />\n\nThen press on three dots on MQTT integration and choose `System Options` and check if automatically adding new devices is enabled:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/add-dev.jpg\" />\n\n\nNow it's time to add some devices to your smart home. Depending on the hardware you have, pick one of the options:\n\n**Option 1 (with zigbee2MQTT)**\n* If you have Zigbee adapter [JetHome USB JetStick Z2](https://jethome.ru/z2/)\n(or one of [supported](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html)) go [**here.**](/docs/zigbee-to-mqtt/)\n\n**Option 2 (with SLS Gateway)**\n* If you have [Robonomics SLS Gateway](https://easyeda.com/ludovich88/robonomics_sls_gateway_v01) go [**here.**](/docs/sls-gateway/)\n\n","tools":["Mosquitto Broker 2.0.11 https://mosquitto.org/","Home Assistant 2022.11.3 https://github.com/home-assistant/core"],"fileInfo":{"path":"ko/mqtt-setup.md","name":"mqtt-setup"}}},"context":{}}
