Requirements: [Metamask extension](https://metamask.io/)**\n\nTo get the weather from sensor on Fuji Mountain, please, open the page of [Fuji Weather sensor](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/fuji/airalab/QmbQT8cj9TJKfYVaidfShnrEX1g14yTC9bdG1XbcRX73wY/0x4D8a26e1f055c0b28D71cf1deA05f0f595a6975d/) in Robonomics dApp and follow instructions below.\n\nHere's a walkthrough video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/t098NlMELk4\n\n## 1. Open the Dapp\n\nIn case you don't have MetaMask extension you'll see the picture below. Go to the link provided above and install one.\n\n![\"Robonomics dApp if no MetaMask installed\"](../images/sensor-demo/sensor-demo-1.png \"Robonomics dApp if no MetaMask installed\")\n\n## 2. Allow connection to the extension\n![\"Connection to Robonomics dApp via Metamask\"](../images/sensor-demo/sensor-demo-2.png \"Connection to Robonomics dApp via Metamask\")\n\n## 3. Press \"Request current values\"\n![\"Request sensor's data in Robonomics network via dApp\"](../images/sensor-demo/sensor-demo-3.png \"Request sensor's data in Robonomics network via dApp\")\n\n## 4. Sign a message. No token or ether are needed\n![\"Sign a message in Robonomics network via dApp\"](../images/sensor-demo/sensor-demo-4.png \"Sign a message in Robonomics network via dApp\")\n\n## 5. Wait until the agent collects the data and sends it back\n![\"Wait for response of the agent in Robonomics network via dApp\"](../images/sensor-demo/sensor-demo-5.png \"Wait for response of the agent in Robonomics network via dApp\")\n\n## 6. Wait until the Dapp downloads the result file from IPFS\n![\"Wait for IPFS file with results in Robonomics network via dApp\"](../images/sensor-demo/sensor-demo-6.png \"Wait for IPFS file with results in Robonomics network via dApp\")\n\n## 7. Look at the weather data on Fuji Mountain\n![\"The results of sensor network in Robonomics via dApp\"](../images/sensor-demo/sensor-demo-7.png \"The results of sensor network in Robonomics via dApp\")\n\nJust now you have broadcasted a demand message and got a result from an autonomous agent! The result file is stored in IPFS, the result message is signed with the agent's private key.\n","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"ko/get-weather-on-fuji-mountain.md","name":"get-weather-on-fuji-mountain"}}},"context":{}}
