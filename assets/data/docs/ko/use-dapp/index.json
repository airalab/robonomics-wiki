Let's start with telemetry.\n\n## SmartHome Telemetry\n\nGo to DApp and  choose service [\"SmartHome Telemetry\"](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/services). You will forward to DApp website. In first login give permission to website to use polkadot{.js} extension. You will see next:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/telemetry-start.jpg\" />\n\nIn account's list find address of `SUB_ADMIN`. Press green button in the raw with account.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/admin-tel.jpg\" />\n\nNow `SUB_ADMIN` address became **blue**. Press on it, and you will go to datalog page. Here You will see all your **\"telemetry datalogs\"**.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/tel-datalog.jpg\" />\n\nLet's read the latest telemetry datalog. Insert `SUB_ADMIN` seed in secret key field. Then press **READ**. Wait until DApp will load telemetry and then press **DECRYPT** button. You will get your telemetry from all sensors.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/telemetry.jpg\"/>\n\nThat's all.\n\n## Launch devices\n\nGo to DApp and  choose service [\"SmartHome Telemetry\"](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/services). You will forward to DApp website. In first login give permission to website to use polkadot{.js} extension. You will see next:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/telemetry-start.jpg\" />\n\nFind address of your `user` account and press blue button:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/datalog-start.jpg\" />\n\nAnd you will see popup \"Launch\" window:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/launch-window.jpg\" />\n\nLaunch command call HomeAssistant service, so first two fields are **service name** - \"Platform\" and **service function** - \"Name\". Let's find them.\n\nFor this go to your Home Assistant interface in browser -> `Developer tools` -> `SERVICES` and turn on `YAML mode`.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/ha-services.jpg\" />\n\nstart write service, which you want to find in a field.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/ha-light.jpg\" />\n\nLet's find a `light` service. You will see available functions(`turn_on`, `turn_off`, `toggle`). Choose `turn_on` function.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/ha-light-on.jpg\" />\n\nOn the picture you see **service name** - `light` and **service function** - `turn_on`. Write this statements to popup window.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/light-window.jpg\" />\n\nNext we need to find sensor ID. for this go to main window `Overview`. Find sensor, which you want to turn on(in our example it is light) and press on it. \n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/light-name.jpg\" />\n\nYou will see popup window and \"settings\" button on it right top corner. Press on it. Popup window will change. In new window you will find required `entity_id`:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/entity-ha.jpg\" />\n\nCopy it and paste to field in our dapp:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/dapp-entity.jpg\" />\n\nFinally, press `SEND` button and sign transaction with your password. Wait until transaction will be in block check your light. It should be turned on (sometimes it takes a bit more time).\n\nCongratulations, You fully installed and setup Your Home Assistant with Robonomics!\n\n","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"ko/use-dapp.md","name":"use-dapp"}}},"context":{}}
