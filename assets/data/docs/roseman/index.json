It is needed for accumulating sensors \ndata to show measurement history.\n\n## Requirements\n\nFirst, RoSeMAN requires **Mongodb** [Database server.](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/introduction/) \nIn this article the installation process isn't discussed, it is assumed that you already have it. \n\nAlso, you have to turn on \"Datalog\" option for Sensors Connectivity module, as shown in \"Scenario #3\" in [\"Configuration Options Description\" article.](/docs/configuration-options-description/)\nYou should have XRT on your robonomics account, which connected to Sensors Connectivity **Datalog**.\n\n## Setup\n\nFirst, download repository:\n\n```shell\ngit clone https://github.com/airalab/RoSeMAN.git\ncd RoSeMAN\n```\n\nThen create configuration files:\n\n```shell\ncp config.template.json config.json\ncp agents.template.json agents.json\n```\n\nOpen `config.json` file and edit database path:\n\n```json\n...\n  \"DB\": {\n    \"path\": \"mongodb://localhost:27017/rosemandb\"\n  },\n...\n```\n\nThen add public address of your account to `agents.json` file. You can add several addresses to file, \nif you want to collect data from different Sensors Connectivity modules. Example of file:\n\n```shell\n[\n  \"4Cewrqmbbmu8SMXp7sUpxCtwTshzdap8jk6JLSXVvGxCX56o\"\n]\n```\n\nNext, install dependencies and build server:\n\n```shell\nyarn install\nyarn build\n```\n\nFinally, start RoSeMAN server:\n\n```shell\nyarn start\n```\n\nWeb server launched at `http://127.0.0.1:3000`.\n\n## Post-installation\n\nAfter deployment of the RoSeMAN service to a server you have to get public IP address or URL to server. \nAlternatively, if you run RoSeMAN service and Sensors Map on the same server, you can use local IP address.\n\nNext, you have to open Sensors Map configuration file(check [previous article](/docs/deploy-sensor-map/)) \nand insert URL in `config.js` file into `REMOTE_PROVIDER` field:\n\n```json\n...\n  },\n  REMOTE_PROVIDER: \"https://roseman.examlpe.org/\",\n  WIND_PROVIDER: \"\",\n  MAP: {\n...\n```\n\nThen rebuild map with `yarn build` and start it again. Now you will be able to see measurement history.","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"roseman.md","name":"roseman"}}},"context":{}}
