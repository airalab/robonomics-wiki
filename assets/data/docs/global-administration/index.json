Also, you can't take the  user, \nwhich you have created at first start of Home Assistant, because this user doesn't \nhave account in Robonomics Parachain.\n\nLet's create an account, as we did in the previous [article](/docs/sub-activate/). \nAdd this account to the subscription [here](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/subscription/devices). Now there should be three addresses in the access list - `SUB_OWNER`, `SUB_CONTROLLER` and `user`.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/user.jpg\" />\n\nThen go to the Dapp service [**\"HomeAssistant Account\"**](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/home-assistant). Choose account, \nyou've just created at the right sidebar (check that you have chosen the intended account by pressing the profile icon).\nThen enter the `USER` seed in the required field. In the next two raws type in `SUB_OWNER` and `SUB_CONTROLLER` addresses:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/acc-pass.jpg\" />\n\nIf everything right, you will see ** 3. Verification status ** - `Verified`.\n\nCreate a password for a new HA user which you have just registered. Type the passport below `Your Home Assistant password` and click \"create password\". Confirm transaction. (Later you can restore it in \"restore\" tab.)\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/password.jpg\" />\n\nItâ€™s free now since the accounts are using RWS subscription. After the registration process, you can log in to Home Assistant with your address as `login` and a newly-created password. Go to login page and login:\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/acc-login.jpg\" />\n\nThat's all. \n\nCheck [\"SmartHome Telemetry\"](/docs/use-dapp/) article to get data about your home through the Robonomics.","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"global-administration.md","name":"global-administration"}}},"context":{}}
