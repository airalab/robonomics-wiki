Create an account on Robonomics parachain, as you did in the [previous article](/docs/sub-activate/).\n\n2. Using `OWNER` account add new user account to the subscription on the `SETUP A SUBSCRIPTION` page in [Robonomics DApp](https://robonomics.app/#/rws-setup). Now in `USERS IN SUBSCRIPTION` section should be three addresses in the access list: `OWNER`, `CONTROLLER` and `USER`.\n\n\n## RWS Setup JSON File\n\nFirstly, user should get the JSON file with the information of the RWS Setup.\n\n### Create RWS Setup JSON\n\nAdministrator can create JSON file for his setup in [SETUP A SUBSCRIPTION](https://robonomics.app/#/rws-setup) page using `Download import for other users` button.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/download_rws_setup_json.png\" />\n\n### Import RWS Setup\n\nNow with this JSON file user can import RWS setup using `IMPORT SETUP` button.\n\n<robo-wiki-video autoplay loop controls :videos=\"[{src: 'https://crustipfs.art/ipfs/QmYr9shCyFzMNLEeP8LC6ZRiEF2YpMaoDrrs587QpTvsgY', type:'mp4'}]\" />\n\n## Granting Access to User\n\nOn the same page ([SETUP A SUBSCRIPTION](https://robonomics.app/#/rws-setup)) you can set the password for the new user.\n\n<robo-wiki-video autoplay loop controls :videos=\"[{src: 'https://crustipfs.art/ipfs/Qme28Bq4qtHcqmndrDpUh5eQU5NbdnbHq76kxcS1HmvKQE', type:'mp4'}]\" />\n\n1. Choose the account you've just created at the right sidebar (check that you have chosen the intended account by pressing the profile icon).\n\n2. Enter the `USER`'s address and seed phrase in the required fields.\n\n3. Fill in a password and then confirm the transaction by the `CREATE PASSWORD` button, that will now be without fee due to the subscription.\n\n4. After the registration process, log in to Home Assistant with your user address as login and a newly-created password.\n\nNow you can use the dapp to control your home through Robonomics, check [**\"Get Smart Home Telemetry\"**](/docs/smart-home-telemetry/) article.\n\n","tools":["Robonomics 2.7.0-1 https://github.com/airalab/robonomics","Robonomics Dapp v0.6.0 https://github.com/airalab/robonomics.app"],"fileInfo":{"path":"global-administration.md","name":"global-administration"}}},"context":{}}
