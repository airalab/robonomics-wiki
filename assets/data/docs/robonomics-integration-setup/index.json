This allows Home Assistant to record datalogs with encrypted data to Robonomics Parachain and listen for launch commands from the parachain to control smart devices. Integration uses IPFS to store data and send IPFS hashes to datalog or launch functions.**\n\nIn the web interface of Home Assistant go to `Settings` -> `Device & Services` and press `ADD INTEGRATION`.
