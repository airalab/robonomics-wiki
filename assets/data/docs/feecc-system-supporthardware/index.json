But RFID and barcode scanners, a\nsingle board or desktop computer, and a camera on each desk are mandatory.**\n\n#### **RFID scanner**\n\n> A USB RFID scanner is needed to authorize engineers in the field with their internal badges. Incoming information is\n> processed using the [feecc-hid-reader-daemon](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-hid-reader-daemon).\n\nRequired technical specifications:\n\n- Operating frequency - 125kHz.\n\n*You can buy\nit [here](https://aliexpress.ru/item/1005003579675742.html?spm=a2g2w.productlist.0.0.190ad16cWCptVr&sku_id=12000026804509353)\n.*\n\n#### **Barcode scanner**\n\n> The USB barcode scanner is necessary for identifying products by barcodes, sending commands to services and for the\n> correct assignment of certificates. It is also used to read QR codes to identify certificates. The incoming information\n> is also processed with the [feecc-hid-reader-daemon](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-hid-reader-daemon).\n\nRequired technical specifications:\n\n- Reading in two dimensions (desirable, but not required).\n\n*You can buy\nit [here](https://aliexpress.ru/item/32902727438.html?spm=a2g2w.productlist.0.0.263d68c5fTwi8J&sku_id=10000009784771593)\n.*\n\n#### **Work computer**\n\n> A small single-board computer. It processes signals from external devices (barcode scanner, RFID scanner), sends\n> requests for printing images on the printer, starting and stopping video recording, sending data to IPFS and the\n> Robonomics platform. It runs the following\n> services: [feecc-workbench-frontend](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-workbench-frontend)\n> , [feecc-workbench-daemon](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-workbench-daemon)\n> , [feecc-hid-reader-daemon](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-hid-reader-daemon). An Internet connection via Wi-Fi\n> or LAN is required.\n\nIt is worth specifying that any computer can be used instead of a single-payer computer with a monitor. The operating\nsystem [GNU/LINUX](https://www.gnu.org/) must be installed on it natively or through a virtual machine.\n\nMinimum technical specifications:\n\n- Raspberry Pi4 4 GB RAM, it is possible to use an analogue.\n\n*You can buy it [here](https://www.cytron.io/p-raspberry-pi-4-model-b-4gb).*\n\n#### **Touch screen**\n\n> The monitor is used by the employee to enter and view information about the current production step. It also displays\n> hints for the engineer on the current stage.\n\nRequired technical specifications:\n\n- Touch screen (desirable but not necessary. Other input devices can be used).\n\n*You can buy it [here](https://www.asus.com/Displays-Desktops/Monitors/Touch/VT168H/).*\n\n#### **Label printer**\n\n> The label printer is used to print QR codes and bar codes for further placement of labels on the product for\n> identification and verification purposes. Interaction with the printer is carried out with the help of\n> the [feecc-print-server](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-print-server).\n\nRequired technical specifications:\n\n- This option uses Brother model QL-800 printers.\n\n*You can buy it [here](https://www.brother-usa.com/products/ql800).*\n\n#### **IP Camera**\n\n> IP camera for capturing production processes for inclusion in the product certificate. Located above the assembly area\n> of the product. Interaction with the camera is performed using\n> the [feecc-cameraman](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-cameraman) service.\n\nRequired technical specifications:\n\n- PoE power supply.\n- RTSP data transfer protocol.\n- This option uses Hikvision HiWatch DS-i200d\n\n*You can buy\nit [here](https://www.hi-watch.eu/en-us/product/1986/ip-camera/bullet-camera/2-0-mp-ir-network-bullet-camera).*\n\n> **The latest version [feecc-cameraman](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-cameraman) supports WEB cameras, so pay\nattention to this detail when choosing equipment.**\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"warning\">\nThe equipment shown below is used for several tables at once.\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n#### **Router or switch that supports PoE 802.3af**\n\n> Router or switch with PoE 802.3af support for powering IP cameras and connecting them to\n> the [feecc-cameraman](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-cameraman) service.\n\nRequired technical specifications:\n\n- PoE power on the output ports.\n- This variant used MikroTik hEX PoE - one for 3-4 workplaces + power supply.\n\n*You can buy it with the following links: [router](https://mikrotik.com/product/RB960PGS)\nand [power adapter](https://mikrotik.com/product/48POW).*\n\n#### **Optional, Fixed Server**\n\n> A more powerful server than the single board computers. It can\n> run [feecc-ipfs-gateway](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-ipfs-gateway)\n> , [feecc-print-server](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-print-server)\n> , [feecc-cameraman](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-cameraman). Can be located in place of one of the computers\n> of the engineers' workplaces. The connection to the Internet is LAN.\n\nRequired technical specifications:\n\n- Intel® Xeon® E-2200 processor or equivalent\n- RAM from 8 Gb\n- Hard drive from 1 Tb\n- LAN network interface from 1 Gbit/s\n\n*You can buy it [here](https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/cty/pdp/spd/poweredge-r240/pe_r240_tm_vi_vp_sb).*\n\n### Feecc Analytics\n\nThe only hardware required for the module to work is a local or remote server (virtual machine) on which the \"Feecc\nAnalytics\" web application will run. Each authorized employee can access the web application from his/her computer with\na username and password.","tools":["Feecc Workbench daemon https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-workbench-daemon","Feecc IPFS gateway https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-ipfs-gateway","Feecc Print server https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-print-server","Feecc Cameraman https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-cameraman","Feecc HID reader daemon https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-hid-reader-daemon"],"fileInfo":{"path":"feecc-system-supporthardware.md","name":"feecc-system-supporthardware"}}},"context":{}}
