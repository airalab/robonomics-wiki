Depending on the\ntask the engineer may need the following devices:\n\n- IP or Web camera to organize video recording of the production process.\n- RFID reader for identification in the system by personal RFID card.\n- Barcode reader for scanning product labels.\n- Label printer for labeling the manufactured products.\n- Digital sensors collecting data from various devices/stations\n\nFeecc The Engineer's workplace usually consists of the following containers:\n\n- Installation is mandatory on the computer from which the product is assembled:\n\n    - [feecc-workbench-frontend](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-workbench-frontend)\n    - [feecc-workbench-daemon](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-workbench-daemon)\n    - [feecc-hid-reader-daemon](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-hid-reader-daemon)\n\n- Installation can be carried out both on the computer from which the product is assembled, and on a server or other\n  device in the local network:\n\n    - [feecc-ipfs-gateway](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-ipfs-gateway)\n    - [feecc-print-server](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-print-server)\n    - [feecc-cameraman](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-cameraman)\n\nFigures 1 and 2 show the Feecc Engineer Workplace architecture with decentralized and centralized system organization\ntopology in a corporate environment.\n![architec1](/docs/images/feecc-system-architecture/picture1.png)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\nPicture 1 - Feecc Engineer Workbench architecture with decentralized system organization topology in a corporate environment.\n</p>\n\n![architec2](/docs/images/feecc-system-architecture/picture2.png)\n\n<p align=\"center\">\nPicture 2 - Feecc Engineer Workbench architecture with centralized system organization topology in a corporate environment.\n</p>\n\nThe choice of topology and the deployment of different combinations depends on a company's existing data network,\ninstalled computers, reliability requirements, centralization or decentralization, and much more. All microservice\napplications support the exchange of data over an IP network among themselves.\n\n### Feecc Analytics\n\nThe main task of Feecc Analytics is to organize the process of traceability of finished products and their pre-sales\ninspection in the product quality control department.\n\nFeecc Analytics depends on the following containers:\n\n- [feecc-analytics-frontend](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-analytics-frontend)\n- [feecc-analytics-backend](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-analytics-backend)\n\nAnd it is usually deployed on a single server with a globally routable IP to access Feecc Analytics from the outside,\nbut can also be deployed locally.\n\n### Feecc Validator\n\nThe main task of the Feecc Validator is to compare data from different data stores in order to validate the integrity of\nthe digital product certificate.\n\nFeecc Validator depends on the following containers:\n\n- [feecc-validator-frontend](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-validator-frontend)\n- [feecc-validator-backend](https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-validator-backend)\n\nAnd it is usually deployed on a single server with a globally routable IP to access the Feecc Validator from the\noutside, but can also be deployed locally.
