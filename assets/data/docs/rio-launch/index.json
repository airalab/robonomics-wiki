Basically sending \"ON\" will result in `true` state for a device, anything else will result in `false`.\n\nFor the examples the development network is used. Check [this](/docs/robonomics-test-network-manual/) out to set it up for yourself.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* `robonomics` [executable](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases)\n* Accounts on parachain\n\nYou can find instructions on how to create an account [here](/docs/create-account-in-dapp)\n\n## Usage\n\nTo see the result of transaction first of all run `read` part:\n\n```\n% ./robonomics io read launch\n```\n\nNow let's turn a robot on:\n\n```\n% echo \"ON\" | ./robonomics io write launch -r 5CiPPseXPECbkjWCa6MnjNokrgYjMqmKndv2rSnekmSK2DjL -s 0xb046fc3c322e91e14a61ad4f08a3809ee0de7092e73aa9b3c2b642a0f476d4d6\n```\n\nThen you should see in the first terminal window:\n\n```\n% ./robonomics io read launch\n5H3iRnX16DH2sb2RLxMM8UhDZTvJjP84EhhKXv3sCiEDq6bH >> 5CiPPseXPECbkjWCa6MnjNokrgYjMqmKndv2rSnekmSK2DjL : true\n```\n\nLet's describe all the accounts and options above.\n\n* `-r 5CiPPseXPECbkjWCa6MnjNokrgYjMqmKndv2rSnekmSK2DjL` means robot's address\n* `-s 0xb046fc3c322e91e14a61ad4f08a3809ee0de7092e73aa9b3c2b642a0f476d4d6` private key of the account to launch from (must have tokens for a transaction)\n* `5H3iRnX16DH2sb2RLxMM8UhDZTvJjP84EhhKXv3sCiEDq6bH` address that launches a robot\n* `true` turn it on\n\nIf we pass anything else but \"ON\" the state becomes `false`\n\n## Remote\nIf your local node is configured differently from defaults or you have a remote node, it's possible to specify it with `--remote` option\n\n```\n% echo \"ON\" | ./robonomics io write launch -r 5CiPPseXPECbkjWCa6MnjNokrgYjMqmKndv2rSnekmSK2DjL -s 0xb046fc3c322e91e14a61ad4f08a3809ee0de7092e73aa9b3c2b642a0f476d4d6 --remote https://ipfs.infura.io:5001/\n```\n\nand\n\n```\n% ./robonomics io read launch --remote https://ipfs.infura.io:5001/\n```\n"}},"context":{}}
