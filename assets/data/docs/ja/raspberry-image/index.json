Insert SD card into your PC and run the Imager program. In `Operating System` select `Use custom` and choose the previously downloaded `.img.gz` file. Then select your SD card in the `Storage` dropdown and click `WRITE`.\n\n![imager](../images/home-assistant/use_custom_image.png)\n![imager](../images/home-assistant/imager_prep.png)\n\nAfter writing is comleted, open the SD card's files on your computer and navigate inside the root folder of the card. The name should be something similar to `system-boot`.\n\nFind the file named `network-config` and open it in a text editor. Write this to the file:\n```\nversion: 2\nethernets:\n  eth0:\n    dhcp4: true\n    optional: true\nwifis:\n  wlan0:\n    dhcp4: true\n    optional: true\n    access-points:\n      \"YOUR_WIFI_NAME\":\n        password: \"YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD\"\n```\n**Make sure that you input your actual wifi name and your wifi password.** Then you need to save the file, and insert the SD card to the Raspberry Pi and turn it on. It must connect to your wi-fi network, now you need to find its address. Firstly find your address in the local network with:\n\n```bash\nip a\n```\nIt must look like `192.168.xx.xx` or `172.xx.xx.xx`.\n\nThen scan the network with your address and zero in the end:\n\n```bash \n$ sudo nmap -sP 192.168.xx.0/24\nStarting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-26 13:50 CEST\nNmap scan report for _gateway (192.168.43.1)\nHost is up (0.015s latency).\nMAC Address: 8E:F5:A3:DB:03:27 (Unknown)\nNmap scan report for ubuntu (192.168.43.56)\nHost is up (0.049s latency).\nMAC Address: DC:A6:32:02:46:50 (Raspberry Pi Trading)\nNmap scan report for LAPTOP-27UBLNO7 (192.168.43.234)\nHost is up (0.00057s latency).\nMAC Address: 7C:B2:7D:9E:95:DA (Intel Corporate)\nNmap scan report for ed-vm (192.168.43.138)\nHost is up.\nNmap done: 256 IP addresses (4 hosts up) scanned in 2.07 seconds\n```\nThere raspberry's address is `192.168.43.56`. Now you can connect to it over ssh:\n```bash\nssh ubuntu@192.168.43.56\n```\nPassword is \"ubuntu\". Then follow the instructions to change the password.\n\nThen you need to write the seed from your Robonomics account to config file. Open it:\n```bash\nsudo -u homeassistant -H -s\nnano /srv/homeassistant/python_scripts/config.config\n```\nAnd add mnemonic:\n```\n[user]\nSEED = <your mnemonic or raw seed>\n```\nThen restart Robonomics Control service:\n```bash\nsystemctl restart robonomics-control@homeassistant.service\n```\n\nAfter that you can connect your devices:\n- [Connection with zigbee2MQTT](/docs/zigbee2-mqtt/)\n- [Connection through Xiaomi Gateway](/docs/xiaomi-gateway/)\n- [Connect Vacuum Cleaner](/docs/vacuum-connect/)\n"}},"context":{}}
