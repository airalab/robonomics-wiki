If you have one with some vital\n  information, please install Home Assistant **Docker** or **Core** following \n  [official guides](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi) and then augment them with Robonomics. There \n  are dedicated guides to add Robonomics Integration to your existing Home Assistant [Core](/docs/hass-install-core) and\n  [Docker](/docs/hass-install-docker).\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n## Get image\n\nTo simplify the installation process when starting from scratch, a pre-made image may be used. It contains Home Assistant\nCore with Robonomics integration and IPFS.\n\nTo download it, IPFS is to be used. [Install IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/) and start the daemon \n(Don't forget to run `ipfs init` before the first start):\n```shell\nipfs daemon\n```\n\nIn other terminal download image with\n\n```shell\nipfs get QmR92hqCvqy5Vzxyszobb6o5tPkeFNNTy5ZZsVBFVDheFR -o rpi.img.xz\n```\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\" title=\"Browser alternative\">\n\n  Alternatively, you can download it \n  [from GitHub releases.](https://github.com/nakata5321/Robonomics-HomeAssistant-image/releases)\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n\nProceed to the next chapter to install the image.\n\n## Configure Image\n\nInstall [balena etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) on your computer. Then, insert the SD card and run the Imager program. \nSelect required image as the operating system and ensure to select your SD card from the storage dropdown, and then `flash` image.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/balena.jpg\" alt=\"Balena installer\" />\n\nAfter flashing, open the SD card's storage and navigate inside the `boot` folder of the card.\n\nInside this folder you need to create a `wpa_supplicant.conf` file, where you will provide your network credentials.\nPaste the following to the file:\n```shell\nctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev\nupdate_config=1\ncountry=<Insert 2 letter ISO 3166-1 country code here>\n\nnetwork={\n        scan_ssid=1\n        ssid=\"<Name of your wireless LAN>\"\n        psk=\"<Password for your wireless LAN>\"\n        proto=RSN\n        key_mgmt=WPA-PSK\n        pairwise=CCMP\n        auth_alg=OPEN\n}\n```\nAnd set `ssid`, `psk` and `country` code according to yours. You can find country codes [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_3166_country_codes). \n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"warning\">\n  Make sure that you input your actual Wi-Fi name and your Wi-Fi password.\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\"> This way of setting Wi-Fi credentials is only available before the first boot. If you need to change it later, please, use `sudo raspi-config` command. \n</robo-wiki-note>\n\nThen you need to save the file, **safely eject the SD card**, and insert it into the Raspberry Pi and turn it on. It should connect to your wi-fi network. \n\n> After your Raspberry Pi is plugged in, make sure to wait a few (up to 5) minutes for it to boot up and register on the network. \n\nNow find the Raspberry Pi's IP address. To find address you can use [Fing mobile app](https://www.fing.com/products)\nor [nmap CLI tool](https://vitux.com/find-devices-connected-to-your-network-with-nmap/).  In this example the Raspberry Pi's address is `192.168.43.56`.\nConnect to it over `ssh`:\n\n```bash\nssh ubuntu@192.168.43.56\n```\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\"> User is \"ubuntu\". Password is \"ubuntu\". </robo-wiki-note>\n\n\nNow that you have a Raspberry Pi with Home Assistant, Robonomics and IPFS installed, proceed to the [Home Assistant Init](/docs/hass-init/)\npage where you initialize your new Home Assistant and then add MQTT integration to it. After that you will\nconnect your Zigbee devices to your Home Assistant.","tools":["Home Assistant 2022.11.3 https://github.com/home-assistant/core","Robonomics integration 1.1.3 https://github.com/airalab/homeassistant-robonomics-integration","robonomics-interface 1.3.6 https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/robonomics-interface/","IPFS 0.14.0 https://docs.ipfs.tech/"],"fileInfo":{"path":"ja/hass-install-image.md","name":"hass-install-image"}}},"context":{}}
