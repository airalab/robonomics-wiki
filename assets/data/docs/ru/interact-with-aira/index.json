AIRA image doesn't support clipboard, so to make life easier have a look at [Connect via SSH](/docs/aira-connecting-via-ssh/) and log in via SSH to the VM.\n\nWalkthrough video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/embed/QM06l07_wuA\n\n## Package installation\n\nAfter you launched AIRA and logged in using your terminal do the following:\n\n```\nsu liability && cd\ngit clone https://github.com/vourhey/hello_aira\ncd hello_aira\nnix build -f release.nix\nsource result/setup.bash\nrosrun hello_aira hello_aira\n```\n\nRun one by one commands above. After the last one you should see a link to DApp generated specifically for your instance.\n\n![Terminal with AIRA](../images/aira_hello_terminal.jpg \"Terminal with AIRA\")\n\nClick on the link, the DApp should be shown.\n\n## DApp \n\nConnect [MetaMask](http://metamask.io/) if prompted and click on the button\n\n![Request connection in Robonomics Dapp](../images/aira_hello_dapp.jpg \"Request connection in Robonomics Dapp\")\n\nSign the message as usual and wait for the result\n\n![Wait for Result of request](../images/aira_hello_dapp_2.jpg \"Wait for Result of request\")\n\nMeanwhile have a look at the terminal. You should see the greeting\n\n![AIRA greeting in terminal](../images/aira_hello_terminal_2.jpg \"AIRA greeting in terminal\")\n\nIn the end the greeting will appear in the DApp\n\n![Robonomics DApp Greeting for AIRA](../images/aira_hello_dapp_3.jpg \"Robonomics DApp Greeting for AIRA\")\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n### You click \"Request current values\" but see no greeting\n\nProbably you have just launched AIRA and IPFS hasn't finished initialization. Wait a minute or so and try again.\n\n### I see response hash but the data doesn't appear\n\nAgain most probably the issue comes from IPFS connection. Click and the hash and you'll see the result. It's not necessary to download the file.\n\n## Home Task (optional)\n\nIf you are familiar with [Python](https://www.python.org/) change the shown text to something different and complete the lesson with your version of `hello_aira`\n\n- Make a fork of the [repository](https://github.com/vourhey/hello_aira)\n- The output text is located [here](https://github.com/Vourhey/hello_aira/blob/master/scripts/hello_aira#L45)\n","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"ru/interact-with-aira.md","name":"interact-with-aira"}}},"context":{}}
