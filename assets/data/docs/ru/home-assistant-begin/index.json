Brands such as Xiaomi and Aqara work through a proprietary gateway. As a result, you as a user are always dependent on the hardware and infrastructure vendor to run the entire system.\n\nWe see two main problems with this approach:\n\n1. Having a single point of failure in the form of vendor clouds\n2. You have no control over what data you share\n\nTo solve the first problem, you can install and configure a local server running software such as [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) or [openHAB](https://www.openhab.org/).\n\nAnd to ensure the safe management of your smart home from anywhere in the world, the technologies of the [Robonomics](https://robonomics.network/) platform come to the rescue.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/0Li2jhMTt0w\n\nIn this section, step by step, you will be able to set up your smart home to work through Robonomics.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Raspberry Pi 4\n* SD card and SD adapter\n* Zigbee smart devices (any from [supported devices](https://slsys.io/action/supported_devices.html))\n* Zigbee adapter [JetHome USB JetStick Z2](https://jethome.ru/z2/) (or one of [supported](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html)) or [Robonomics SLS Gateway](https://easyeda.com/ludovich88/robonomics_sls_gateway_v01)\n","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"ru/home-assistant-begin.md","name":"home-assistant-begin"}}},"context":{}}
