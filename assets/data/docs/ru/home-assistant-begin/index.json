You need Robonomics [accounts](/docs/create-account-in-dapp/) for each device, they will publish encrypted data in datalog. Also you need user account that will send commands to devices end encrypt/decrypt data.\n\nIn this video you can see the example of connecting temperature sensor:\n\nhttps://youtu.be/iB2Z8HtERgs\n\n# Requirements\n\n* Raspberry Pi 4 or 3\n* SD card and SD adapter\n* Temperature sensor - [Keen Home RS-THP-MP-1.0](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/devices/RS-THP-MP-1.0.html) (or another [supported device](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_devices.html))\n\n### Method 1 (with SLS Gateway)\n* [Robonomics SLS Gateway](https://easyeda.com/ludovich88/robonomics_sls_gateway_v01)\n\n### Method 2 (with zigbee2MQTT)\n* Zigbee adapter [JetHome USB JetStick Z2](https://jhome.ru/catalog/parts/PCBA/293/) (or one of [supported](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/information/supported_adapters.html))\n\n### Method 3 (with Xiaomi Gateway)\n* Xiaomi Gateway (one of [supported](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/xiaomi_miio#xiaomi-gateway))\n* [Mi Home app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.xiaomi.smarthome&hl=ru&gl=US) or HomeKit app\n\nAlso you can connect some devices directly through Mi Home app (for example, Vacuum Cleaner).\n\n# Setup\n\n1. First you need to [setup Raspberry Pi](/docs/raspberry-setup/) (also you can [use prepared image](/docs/raspberry-image/)).\n2. Then you need to connect devices to Home Assistant:\n- [Connection with zigbee2MQTT](/docs/zigbee2-mqtt/)\n- [Setup SLS Gateway](/docs/sls-setup) and [connect it to Home Assistant](/docs/sls-gateway-connect)\n- [Connection through Xiaomi Gateway](/docs/xiaomi-gateway/)\n- [Connect Vacuum Cleaner](/docs/vacuum-connect/)\n3. And [connect them to Robonomics Network](/docs/add-smart-device-to-robonomics/).\n"}},"context":{}}
