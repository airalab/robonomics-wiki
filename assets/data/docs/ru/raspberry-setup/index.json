Then, insert the SD card and run the Imager program. From the menu, select 64-bit Ubuntu Server as the operating system and ensure to select your SD card from the storage dropdown, and then press `write`.\n\n![pi](../images/home-assistant/pi.png)\n\nOpen the SD card's storage from your computer and navigate inside the root folder of the card. The name of the folder should be something similar to `system-boot`.\n\nFind the file named `network-config` and open it in a text editor. Copy the below text and paste it into the file:\n```\nversion: 2\nethernets:\n  eth0:\n    dhcp4: true\n    optional: true\nwifis:\n  wlan0:\n    dhcp4: true\n    optional: true\n    access-points:\n      \"YOUR_WIFI_NAME\":\n        password: \"YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD\"\n```\n\n**Make sure that you input your actual wifi name and your wifi password.** Then you need to save the file, and insert the SD card to the Raspberry Pi and turn it on. It must connect to your wi-fi network, now you need to find its address. Firstly find your address in the local network with:\n```bash\nip a\n```\nIt must look like `192.168.xx.xx` or `172.xx.xx.xx`.\n\nThen scan the network with your address and zero in the end:\n\n```bash \n$ sudo nmap -sP 192.168.xx.0/24\nStarting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-26 13:50 CEST\nNmap scan report for _gateway (192.168.43.1)\nHost is up (0.015s latency).\nMAC Address: 8E:F5:A3:DB:03:27 (Unknown)\nNmap scan report for ubuntu (192.168.43.56)\nHost is up (0.049s latency).\nMAC Address: DC:A6:32:02:46:50 (Raspberry Pi Trading)\nNmap scan report for LAPTOP-27UBLNO7 (192.168.43.234)\nHost is up (0.00057s latency).\nMAC Address: 7C:B2:7D:9E:95:DA (Intel Corporate)\nNmap scan report for ed-vm (192.168.43.138)\nHost is up.\nNmap done: 256 IP addresses (4 hosts up) scanned in 2.07 seconds\n```\nIn this example we can see that the Raspberry Pi's address is `192.168.43.56`. Now you can connect to it over ssh:\n```bash\nssh ubuntu@192.168.43.56\n```\nPassword is \"ubuntu\".\n\n## Home Assistant\n\nNow we need to install Home Assistant to the Raspberry Pi. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/linux#install-home-assistant-core). You need to install `Home Assistant Core`. It's actual version is 2021.11.5 and instruction assumes that we already have installed Python 3.9 or newer.\n\nUpdate your system and install necessary packages:\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade -y\nsudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-dev python3-venv python3-pip libffi-dev libssl-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev autoconf build-essential libopenjp2-7 libtiff5 libturbojpeg0 tzdata libcurl4-openssl-dev\n```\nCreate user `homeassistant` and the directory for homeassistant core:\n```bash\nsudo useradd -rm homeassistant\nsudo mkdir /srv/homeassistant\nsudo chown homeassistant:homeassistant /srv/homeassistant\n```\nNext up is to create and change to a virtual environment for Home Assistant Core. This will be done as the homeassistant account.\n```bash\nsudo -u homeassistant -H -s\ncd /srv/homeassistant\npython3.9 -m venv .\nsource bin/activate\n```\nThen install required Python packages:\n```bash\npython3 -m pip install wheel\npip3 install homeassistant==2021.11.5\n```\nStart Home Assistant Core for the first time. This will complete the installation for you, automatically creating the `.homeassistant `configuration directory in the `/home/homeassistant` directory, and installing any basic dependencies:\n```bash\nhass\n```\nYou can now reach your installation via the web interface on `http://localhost:8123`. Create user and finish setup, then stop Home Assistant with `Ctrl+C`.\n\nAfter this installation process has been completed, from the`scripts` folder import `send_datalog.py` script which will send received data to Robonomics, `control.py` which allows home assistant to receive commands from datalog, and file `config.config`, containing mnemonic seed:\n\n```bash\ncd /srv/homeassistant/\nmkdir python_scripts\ncd python_scripts/\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/main/python_scripts/send_datalog.py\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/main/python_scripts/control.py\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/main/python_scripts/config.config\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/main/python_scripts/utils.py\n```\n\nAdd mnemonic seed from your account in config.config:\n```\n[secrets]\nMNEMONIC_SEED = <your mnemonic>\n```\n\n## Substrate Interface\n\nTo pub data to Robonomics you need to install `substrate-interface` python package (you need to install RUST before) to your raspberry. \n\nInstall RUST:\n```bash\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\nsource $HOME/.cargo/env\nrustup default nightly\n```\nAnd install necessary python packages to the virtual environment:\n```bash\npip3 install pynacl packaging pycurl\npip3 install substrate-interface==1.1.2\npip3 install python-miio==0.5.8\n```\n## Systemd services\n\nNow change user (you can run under any user, which allows you to use sudo):\n\n```bash\nexit\n```\n\nMove to /etc/systemd/system and create new service for home assistant start: \n\n```bash\ncd /etc/systemd/system\nsudo nano home-assistant@homeassistant.service \n```\n\nPaste the following:\n\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=Home Assistant\nAfter=network-online.target\n[Service]\nType=simple\nUser=%i\nWorkingDirectory=/srv/%i/\nExecStart=/srv/homeassistant/bin/hass -c \"/home/%i/.homeassistant\"\nEnvironment=\"PATH=/srv/%i/bin\"\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nDo the same for robonomics control service:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano robonomics-control@homeassistant.service \n```\nWith:\n\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=Robonomics Control\nAfter=network-online.target\n[Service]\nType=simple\nUser=%i\nWorkingDirectory=/srv/%i/\nExecStart=/srv/homeassistant/bin/python3.9 \"/srv/%i/python_scripts/control.py\"\nEnvironment=\"PATH=/srv/%i/bin\"\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nAnd enable both services:\n```\nsudo systemctl enable home-assistant@homeassistant.service\nsudo systemctl enable robonomics-control@homeassistant.service\n```\n\nAfter that you can connect your devices:\n- [Connection with zigbee2MQTT](/docs/zigbee2MQTT/)\n- [Connection through Xiaomi Gateway](/docs/xiaomi_gateway/)\n- [Connect Vacuum Cleaner](/docs/vacuum_connect/)"}},"context":{}}
