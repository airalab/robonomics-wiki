Then, insert the SD card and run the Imager program. From the menu, select 64-bit Ubuntu Server as the operating system and ensure to select your SD card from the storage dropdown, and then press `write`.\n\n![pi](../images/home-assistant/pi.png)\n\nOpen the SD card's storage from your computer and navigate inside the root folder of the card. The name of the folder should be something similar to `system-boot`.\n\nFind the file named `network-config` and open it in a text editor. Copy the below text and paste it into the file:\n```\nversion: 2\nethernets:\n  eth0:\n    dhcp4: true\n    optional: true\nwifis:\n  wlan0:\n    dhcp4: true\n    optional: true\n    access-points:\n      \"YOUR_WIFI_NAME\":\n        password: \"YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD\"\n```\n\n**Make sure that you input your actual wifi name and your wifi password.** Then you need to save the file, and insert the SD card to the Raspberry Pi and turn it on. It must connect to your wi-fi network, now you need to find its address. Firstly find your address in the local network with:\n```bash\nip a\n```\nIt must look like `192.168.xx.xx` or `172.xx.xx.xx`.\n\nThen scan the network with your address and zero in the end (also you can use `arp -a`):\n\n```bash \n$ sudo nmap -sP 192.168.xx.0/24\nStarting Nmap 7.80 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2020-06-26 13:50 CEST\nNmap scan report for _gateway (192.168.43.1)\nHost is up (0.015s latency).\nMAC Address: 8E:F5:A3:DB:03:27 (Unknown)\nNmap scan report for ubuntu (192.168.43.56)\nHost is up (0.049s latency).\nMAC Address: DC:A6:32:02:46:50 (Raspberry Pi Trading)\nNmap scan report for LAPTOP-27UBLNO7 (192.168.43.234)\nHost is up (0.00057s latency).\nMAC Address: 7C:B2:7D:9E:95:DA (Intel Corporate)\nNmap scan report for ed-vm (192.168.43.138)\nHost is up.\nNmap done: 256 IP addresses (4 hosts up) scanned in 2.07 seconds\n```\n\nIn this example we can see that the Raspberry Pi's address is `192.168.43.56`. Now you can connect to it over ssh:\n```bash\nssh ubuntu@192.168.43.56\n```\nPassword is \"ubuntu\".\n\n## Home Assistant\n\nNow we need to install Home Assistant to the Raspberry Pi. Detailed instructions can be found [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/linux#install-home-assistant-core). You need to install `Home Assistant Core`. It's actual version is 2021.11.5 and instruction assumes that we already have installed Python 3.9 or newer.\n\nUpdate your system and install necessary packages:\n```bash\nsudo apt-get update\nsudo apt-get upgrade -y\nsudo apt-get install -y python3 python3-dev python3-venv python3-pip libffi-dev libssl-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev autoconf build-essential libopenjp2-7 libtiff5 tzdata libcurl4-openssl-dev\n```\n\nCreate user `homeassistant` and the directory for homeassistant core:\n```bash\nsudo useradd -rm homeassistant\nsudo mkdir /srv/homeassistant\nsudo chown homeassistant:homeassistant /srv/homeassistant\n```\n\nNext up is to create and change to a virtual environment for Home Assistant Core. This will be done as the homeassistant account.\n```bash\nsudo -u homeassistant -H -s\ncd /srv/homeassistant\npython3.9 -m venv .\nsource bin/activate\n```\n![terminal1](../images/home-assistant/terminal1.png)\n\nThen install required Python packages:\n```bash\npython3 -m pip install wheel\npip3 install homeassistant==2021.11.5\n```\n\nStart Home Assistant Core for the first time. This will complete the installation for you, automatically creating the `.homeassistant `configuration directory in the `/home/homeassistant` directory, and installing any basic dependencies:\n```bash\n(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant$ hass\n```\n\nYou can now reach your installation via the web interface on `http://%RASPBERRY_IP_ADDRESS%:8123`. \nIn this example: `http://192.168.43.56:8123`\n\n> You don't need to connect you raspberry to the screen, you can open Web UI from any computer connected to your local network\n\nCreate user and finish setup (first setup is described [here](https://www.home-assistant.io/getting-started/onboarding/) in more details), then stop Home Assistant with `Ctrl+C`.\n\nAfter this installation process has been completed, from the `python_scripts` folder import some necessary scripts:\n\n```bash\nmkdir python_scripts\ncd python_scripts/\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/main/python_scripts/send_datalog.py\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/main/python_scripts/control.py\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/main/python_scripts/utils.py\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/main/python_scripts/create_config.py\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/main/python_scripts/decrypt.py\nwget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/airalab/robonomics-smarthome/main/python_scripts/encrypt.py\n```\n\nTo use Robonomics you need account (instructions of how to create it are [here](/docs/create-account-in-dapp/)). Add mnemonic or raw seed from it in `config.config` file:\n```bash\nnano /srv/homeassistant/python_scripts/config.config\n```\n\nIn this format:\n```\n[user]\nSEED = <your mnemonic or raw seed>\n```\n\n## Substrate Interface\n\nTo pub data to Robonomics you need to install `substrate-interface` python package (you need to install RUST before) to your raspberry. \n\nInstall RUST:\n```bash\ncurl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh\nsource $HOME/.cargo/env\nrustup default nightly\n```\n\nAnd install necessary python packages to the virtual environment:\n```bash\npip3 install pynacl==1.4.0 packaging pycurl\npip3 install substrate-interface==1.1.2 --use-feature=2020-resolver\npip3 install python-miio==0.5.8 --use-feature=2020-resolver\n```\nBe sure that you-re on virtual environment:\n\n![terminal1](../images/home-assistant/terminal2.png)\n\n## Systemd services\n\nNow change user (you can run under any user, which allows you to use sudo):\n\n```bash\n(homeassistant) homeassistant@ubuntu:/srv/homeassistant/python_scripts$ exit\n```\n\nCreate new service for home assistant start: \n\n```bash\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/home-assistant@homeassistant.service \n```\n\nPaste the following:\n\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=Home Assistant\nAfter=network-online.target\n[Service]\nType=simple\nUser=%i\nWorkingDirectory=/srv/%i/\nExecStart=/srv/homeassistant/bin/hass -c \"/home/%i/.homeassistant\"\nEnvironment=\"PATH=/srv/%i/bin\"\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nDo the same for robonomics control service:\n\n```bash\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/robonomics-control@homeassistant.service \n```\n\nWith:\n```\n[Unit]\nDescription=Robonomics Control\nAfter=network-online.target\n[Service]\nType=simple\nUser=%i\nWorkingDirectory=/srv/%i/\nExecStart=/srv/homeassistant/bin/python3.9 \"/srv/%i/python_scripts/control.py\"\nEnvironment=\"PATH=/srv/%i/bin\"\n\n[Install]\nWantedBy=multi-user.target\n```\n\nAnd enable both services:\n```bash\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo systemctl enable home-assistant@homeassistant.service\nubuntu@ubuntu:~$ sudo systemctl enable robonomics-control@homeassistant.service\n```\n\nAfter that you can connect your devices:\n- [Connection with zigbee2MQTT](/docs/zigbee2-mqtt/)\n- [Setup SLS Gateway](/docs/sls-setup) and [connect it to Home Assistant](/docs/sls-gateway-connect)\n- [Connection through Xiaomi Gateway](/docs/xiaomi-gateway/)\n- [Connect Vacuum Cleaner](/docs/vacuum-connect/)"}},"context":{}}
