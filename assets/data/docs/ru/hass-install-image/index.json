If you have one with some vital\n  information, please install Home Assistant **Docker** or **Core** following \n  [official guides](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/raspberrypi) and then augment them with Robonomics. There \n  are dedicated guides to add Robonomics Integration to your existing Home Assistant [Core](/docs/hass-install-core) and\n  [Docker](/docs/hass-install-docker).\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n## Get image\n\nTo simplify the installation process when starting from scratch, a pre-made image may be used. It contains Home Assistant\nCore with Robonomics integration and IPFS.\n\nTo download it, IPFS is to be used. [Install IPFS](https://docs.ipfs.tech/install/command-line/) and start the daemon \n(Don't forget to run `ipfs init` before the first start):\n```shell\nipfs daemon\n```\n\nIn other terminal download image with\n\n```shell\nipfs get Qmdca36xtJe86Mni9tAKNXpzihhNVRGKcJfb7xEeUdnfW6 -o rpi.img.xz\n```\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\" title=\"Browser alternative\">\n\n  Alternatively, you can download it \n  [from url.](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmdca36xtJe86Mni9tAKNXpzihhNVRGKcJfb7xEeUdnfW6?filename=rpi_hass.img.gz) \n  (**Only with IPFS Daemon started**)\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n\nProceed to the next chapter to install the image.\n\n## Configure Image\n\nInstall [balena etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) on your computer. Then, insert the SD card and run the Imager program. \nSelect required image as the operating system and ensure to select your SD card from the storage dropdown, and then `flash` image.\n\n<robo-wiki-picture src=\"home-assistant/balena.jpg\" alt=\"Balena installer\" />\n\nOpen the SD card's storage and navigate inside the root folder of the card. The name of the folder should be something similar to `system-boot`.\n\nFind the file named `network-config` and open it in a text editor. Copy the text below and paste it into the file and insert your **wi-fi name** and **wi-fi password**:\n\n```\nversion: 2\nethernets: \n  eth0:\n    dhcp4: true\n    optional: true\nwifis:\n  wlan0:\n    dhcp4: true\n    optional: true\n    access-points:\n      YOUR_WIFI_NAME:\n        password: \"YOUR_WIFI_PASSWORD\"\n```\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"warning\">\n\n  Make sure that you input your actual Wi-Fi name and your Wi-Fi password.\n\n</robo-wiki-note>\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\">This Wi-Fi settings available only on first boot setup.\nIf later you need to change settings, please edit configuration file in `/etc/netplan/` folder. \n</robo-wiki-note>\n\nThen you need to save the file, **safely eject the SD card**, and insert it into the Raspberry Pi and turn it on. It should connect to your wi-fi network. \n\nNow find the Raspberry Pi's IP address. To find address you can use [Fing mobile app](https://www.fing.com/products)\nor [nmap CLI tool](https://vitux.com/find-devices-connected-to-your-network-with-nmap/).  In this example the Raspberry Pi's address is `192.168.43.56`.\nConnect to it over `ssh`:\n\n```bash\nssh ubuntu@192.168.43.56\n```\n\n<robo-wiki-note type=\"note\"> User is \"ubuntu\". Password is \"ubuntu\". </robo-wiki-note>\n\n\nNow that you have a Raspberry Pi with Home Assistant, Robonomics and IPFS installed, proceed to the [Home Assistant Init](/docs/hass-init/)\npage where you initialize your new Home Assistant and then add MQTT integration to it. After that you will\nconnect your Zigbee devices to your Home Assistant.","tools":["Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS https://ubuntu.com/download/raspberry-pi","Home Assistant 2022.8.2 https://github.com/home-assistant/core","Robonomics integration 1.1.0 https://github.com/airalab/homeassistant-robonomics-integration","robonomics-interface 1.3.6 https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/robonomics-interface/","IPFS 0.14.0 https://docs.ipfs.tech/"],"fileInfo":{"path":"ru/hass-install-image.md","name":"hass-install-image"}}},"context":{}}
