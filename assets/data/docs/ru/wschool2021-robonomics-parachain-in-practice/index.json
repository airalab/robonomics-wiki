The target of Robonomics\nis building economy of machines, the parachain in this scope of aims helps to integrate Polkadot ecosystem\nwith IoT, Smart Cities and Industry 4.0 concepts.\n\n## Requirements\n\n* Docker, please [install it](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).\n* Polkadot-launch, please [install it](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-launch#install) (optionally, if you don't want to use docker).\n\n## Launch the relay\n\nThe relay chain is a core of Polkadot, it provides [shared security](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/en/learn-security)\nfor all child parachains and implements message passing mechanics for them. Let's launch local instance of Rococo (polkadot testnet)\nrelay chain with two robonomics-based parachains as a childs. I'll use prepared [Docker image tag: \"winter-school-2\"](https://hub.docker.com/layers/robonomics/robonomics/winter-school-2/images/sha256-92f4795262f3ded3e6a153999d2777c4009106a7d37fd29969ebf1c3a262dc85?context=explore) but all source code of examples\navailable in [Robonomics GitHub](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/tree/master/scripts/polkadot-launch).\n```\ndocker run -ti --rm --network host robonomics/robonomics:winter-school-2 bash\ncd polkadot-launch/\n./launch.sh\n```\n\n<Asciinema vid=\"419Jrg22ziFfMFPZlh2WtiLvg\"/>\n\nIt could take a time, but be partient. As result you should have three chain instances at ports:\n\n* `9944` - local rococo relay chain.\n* `9988` - robonomics parachain with `id=100`\n* `9989` - robonomics parachain with `id=200`\n\nIf you use remote server, you need to create some ssh tunnels on local machine:\n```\nssh -f -N -L 9944:127.0.0.1:9944 root@REMOTE_SERVER_IP\nssh -f -N -L 9988:127.0.0.1:9988 root@REMOTE_SERVER_IP\nssh -f -N -L 9989:127.0.0.1:9989 root@REMOTE_SERVER_IP\n```\nAfter that, you can use `ws://127.0.0.1:9944` for relaychain, `ws://127.0.0.1:9988`and `ws://127.0.0.1:9989` for parachains in https://parachain.robonomics.network/\n\n![relay](../images/ws_lesson4/upcoming.jpg)\n\nSome time ago parachains should be registered.\n\n![relay2](../images/ws_lesson4/parachains.jpg)\n\nAnd start to produce blocks.\n\n![relay3](../images/ws_lesson4/parachains2.jpg)\n\nAs next step let's create HRMP channel to pass messages between parachains. I'll use `sudo` module call on relay chain page.\n\n![hrmp](../images/ws_lesson4/hrmp.jpg)\n\nWhen channel created, the XCM calls is available. Let's use `datalogXcm` pallet - a XCM version of `datalog` pallet in first parachain.\n\n![datalogXcmSend](../images/ws_lesson4/datalogXcmSend.jpg)\n\nAs result message on second parachain will call `datalog` pallet and write data on chain.\n\n![datalogXcmRecv](../images/ws_lesson4/datalogXcmRecv.jpg)\n\nAs result, this example demonstrate how XCM could be used for cross chain usage of standard robonomics pallets.\n","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"ru/wschool2021-robonomics-parachain-in-practice.md","name":"wschool2021-robonomics-parachain-in-practice"}}},"context":{}}
