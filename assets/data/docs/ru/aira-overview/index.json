It implements the standard of economic interaction between human-robot and robot-robot. AIRA makes it possible to connect a variety of different robots under decentralized computer's control (currently supported Ethereum and Polkadot/Substrate).\n\nBasically it is the client for Robonomics Network developed by [Airalab](https://aira.life).\n\nAIRA is NixOS based operating system and officially supports the following architectures: x86, Raspberry Pi 3 B+ and Raspberry Pi 4.\n\nThe most simple way to get familiar with AIRA is to try installing AIRA as a [virtual machine](/docs/aira-installation-on-vb/).\n\nAIRA comes with a few preinstalled and configured services to help you focus on [agent](/docs/glossary#agent) development.\n\nMeanwhile it's highly customizable, but it's recommended to understand [NixOS](http://nixos.org/) and [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/) language.\n\n## What's included? \n\nThe following services are included in the default distribution:\n\n* [Robonomics communication stack](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics_comm)\n* [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/)\n* OpenSSH\n* [cjdns](https://github.com/cjdelisle/cjdns)\n* [Yggdrasil-go](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/)\n\nBesides at the first launch AIRA [generates](/docs/aira-installation-on-vb#launch-the-machine) for you new Ethereum address and IPNS identifier.\n\nIt's possible to use AIRA as a virtual machine or install as a main operating system. Also you can install only the services you need.\n","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"ru/aira-overview.md","name":"aira-overview"}}},"context":{}}
