Yggdrasil Installation \n\nYggdrasil is an early-stage implementation of a fully end-to-end encrypted IPv6 network. Before startitng the lessons you need to install it on your computer.\n\n### For Linux: \nInstallation instructions [here](https://yggdrasil-network.github.io/installation-linux-deb.html).\n\n### For MacOS: \nDownload .pkg file from [here](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go/releases/download/v0.4.0/yggdrasil-0.4.0-macos-amd64.pkg).\n\nLocate the downloaded file in Finder. Right-click it and click Open. Step through the installer as usual.\n\n### For Windows:\nDownload .msi file for [x64 system](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go/releases/download/v0.4.0/yggdrasil-0.4-x64.msi) or for [x32 system](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/yggdrasil-go/releases/download/v0.4.0/yggdrasil-0.4-x86.msi) and run it with double click.\n\n## 2. Open configuration file\n\nYou need to add a list of peers (public nodes) to configuration file so that you will be able to connect to Spot. \n\n### For MacOS and Linux:\nFor that, edit the `yggdrasil.conf` file with this command in a terminal:\n\n```bash\nsudo nano /etc/yggdrasil.conf\n```\n\n### For Windows:\nRun `updateconfig.bat` in `C:/Program Files/Yggdrasil`. \n\nThen in `C:/ProgramData/Yggdrasil` open `yggdrasil.conf` with any text editor.\n\n> `ProgramData` is a hidden folder, so you need to show hidden data.\n\n## 3. Write peers\n\nIn the file that you opened find line `Peers:` (it is at the beginning of the file) add 5-6 peers geografically near to you (write them inside the brackets). You can find list of available peers [here](https://github.com/yggdrasil-network/public-peers) or add peers from example below. Example in yggdrasil.conf:\n\n```bash\n  Peers:\n  [\n    tcp://213.188.199.150:10010\n    tcp://213.188.210.9:10010\n    tcp://[2a09:8280:1::3:312]:10010\n    tcp://[2a09:8280:1::a:2e2]:10010\n    tcp://46.151.26.194:60575\n    tcp://ygg-ru.cofob.ru:18000\n    tcp://ygg.tomasgl.ru:61933\n    tls://185.22.60.71:8443\n    tcp://51.15.118.10:62486\n    tls://ygg.loskiq.dev:17314\n    tls://longseason.1200bps.xyz:13122\n  ]\n  ```\nCheck if the peers online in [Puplic Peers](https://publicpeers.neilalexander.dev/).\n\n## 4. Save and close configuration file\n\n### For Linux and MacOS:\n\nPress `Ctrl+x`, then press `y` to save changes and press `Enter`.\n\n### For Windows:\n\nSave and close file.\n\n## 5. Restart service\n\n### For Linux:\n\nThen restart Yggdrasil using this command:\n\n```bash\nsystemctl restart yggdrasil\n```\n### For macOS:\n\nUnload the service and run Yggdrasil with changed config file:\n\n```bash\nsudo launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/yggdrasil.plist\nsudo yggdrasil -useconffile /etc/yggdrasil.conf\n```\n> You will need to do that before every lesson.\n\n### For Windows:\n\nPress win + r and type `services.msc`, find Yggdrasil service, open it and restart (press Stop and Start).\n\n![win-service](../images/spot/spot-windows.jpg)\n\n## 6. Check Connection\n\nCheck if Yggdrasil works well.\n\nFor that try to ping Spot address:\n```bash\nping strelka.ygg.khassanov.xyz\n```\n> To open terminal in Windows press `Win+R`, type `cmd` and press `Enter`.\n\n> On MacOS use `ping6` instead of `ping`.\n\nIf you can't ping Spot or you had any errors during the Yggdrasil setup look in [Troubleshooting page](/docs/spot-troubleshooting). If you can't find the solution there, please email spot@robonomics.network.\n\n## 7. Create ssh key\n\nYou will connect to Spot via ssh, so you need to create ssh keys which you will use in booking lessons.\n\nRun following command in the terminal:\n```bash\nssh-keygen -t rsa\n```\n> SSH Client is available by default only in Windows 10, so if you use older versions you need to install it. For example you can use [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/).\n\nRemember the path to your key (by default it is `/home/<user>/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` or `C:\\Users\\<user>\\.ssh\\id_rsa.pub`).\n","tools":[],"fileInfo":{"path":"ru/spot-lesson0.md","name":"spot-lesson0"}}},"context":{}}
