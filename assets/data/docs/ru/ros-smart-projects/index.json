Truth be told, there are now so many projects, and the chaoticness of the description style of their repositories grew so much that it is currently quite problematic to find projects dedicated to a specific subject topic. \n\nHere, you’ll find a modest list of ROS-based projects that are dedicated to robots and IoT-devices that are meant for use in a home or office environment. This subject matter is one of the pillars of the Robonomics platform. Our goal is to try and bring these projects on track with Robonomics, from both a technical integration point of view and the perspective of an interesting application of these devices in a robot economy. Feel free to use this list in your search for ideas and inspiration.\n\nYou can check out some examples of ROS-projects integrated with Robonomics in the [Playground Overview page](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/playground-overview/). New projects, including those described here, will be added to the Wiki with time.\n\nAs of right now (**April 2021**), Robonomics is oriented towards ROS **Melodic** and **Noetic** versions. Older versions can also work, but there may be additional integration work needed. In the future, support for ROS version 2 will be added.\n\nThe main resources to search for ROS repositories and packages can be accessed [here](https://index.ros.org/).\n\n## Simulation\n\nBefore shifting our attention solely to devices, it’s worth remembering that for a large quantity of ROS projects, there exists an option to test them in a simulation. The most popular tool for the 3D modeling of various robots under ROS is the [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) simulator and its offshoot project, [Ignition](https://index.ros.org/r/ros_ign/). Both simulators allow to model devices in various difficult indoor and outdoor environments, alter the model and environment itself, test control algorithms and debug before moving over to the real device. Also, this is an excellent tool for training and situations when a real device is absent.\n\nOverall, this is one of the best options for trying to integrate Robonomics with a ROS device without any expenditures at all. A real scenario would merely require slight code modifications. For Gazebo, Robonomics has a detailed guide that consists of two parts that cover [settings](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/connect-any-ros-compatible-robot-under-robonomics-parachain-control-1/) and [integrations](https://wiki.robonomics.network/docs/en/connect-any-ros-compatible-robot-under-robonomics-parachain-control-2/) (using a drone as an example). The main challenge is in finding a ready model (for example, [here](https://github.com/osrf/gazebo_models)) for Gazebo or trying to create your own model using the [SDFormat](http://sdformat.org/) developed for simulators. \n\n## Single-board computers and other boards\n\nSuch boards act as a base component for connecting other devices to ROS, primarily sensors and recording devices (audio, photo, and video recorders, cameras, temperature, pressure, and substance concentration sensors.) because the concept of a smart space implies the creation of a [digital twin](https://gateway.pinata.cloud/ipfs/QmNNdLG3vuTsJtZtNByWaDTKRYPcBZSZcsJ1FY6rTYCixQ/Robonomics_keypoint_March_2021.pdf) of infrastructure objects. Also, boards can act as the main computing device and controller for constructing a robotic mobile device. A list of boards that support ROS is presented below:\n\n| Name and link                                                                                         |                                    Description                                  | ROS version | Last update |\n|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:-----------:|:-----------:|\n|  [Raspberry Pi](http://wiki.ros.org/ROSberryPi/Installing%20ROS%20Melodic%20on%20the%20Raspberry%20Pi)| single board computer; RaspPi versions 2, 3 and 4 are available                 |   melodic   |     2020    |\n|    [Arduino](http://wiki.ros.org/rosserial_arduino)                                                   | single board computer                                                           |    noetic   |     2021    |\n|    [Phidgets](http://wiki.ros.org/phidgets)                                                           | sets of boards, various sensors and devices: Ph sensor, LED, RFID, motor control|    noetic   |     2020    |\n|   [Sense HAT](https://wiki.ros.org/sensehat_ros)                                                      | shield for RaspPi with a set of sensors and LED                                 |    noetic   |     2020    |\n|     [Navio2](https://navio2.emlid.com/)                                                               | autopliot shield for RaspPi 2,3,4                                               |    noetic   |     2020    |\n|     [OpenCR](http://wiki.ros.org/opencr)                                                              | robot controller                                                                |    noetic   |     2021    |\n\n## Smart home devices and household robots\n\nPresented here are ROS devices whose initial use was for smart homes or offices.

The general list of ROS-based mobile platforms is rather large, which is why here we have selected those that are potentially convenient to operate in a home or office space. \n\n| Name and link                                             | Description                                | ROS version | Last update |\n|:---------------------------------------------------------:|--------------------------------------------|:-----------:|:-----------:|\n|   [turtlebot](http://wiki.ros.org/turtlebot3)             | mobile platform tailored for ROS           |    noetic   |     2020    |\n|    [GoPiGo3](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/gopigo3)          | mobile robot based on RaspPi               |   melodic   |     2020    |\n|    [LoCoBot](http://wiki.ros.org/locobot)                 | mobile manipulator                         |   kinetic   |     2020    |\n|   [ROSbot 2.0](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/ROSbot-2.0)     | mobile platform; a simulation is available |    noetic   |     2021    |\n|     [VOLTA](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/Volta)             | mobile platform; a simulation is available |   melodic   |     2021    |\n|    [evarobot](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/evarobot)        | mobile platform; a simulation is available |    noetic   |     2020    |\n|    [Freight](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/freight)          | mobile platform; a simulation is available |   melodic   |     2021    |\n|      [PR2](http://wiki.ros.org/Robots/PR2)                | mobile platform; a simulation is available |   melodic   |     2021    |","tools":[]}},"context":{}}
