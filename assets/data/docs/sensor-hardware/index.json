It also shows the flashing process, but we will talk about it in the next article.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OdTd1sacCso\n\nAfter assembling the sensor, all that remains is to flash and configure it. Go to [the next article](/docs/sensor-setup/) for it.\n\n## Robonomics Board\n\nAlternatively, you can request Robonomics Board. To do so, email one of the following addresses: \n- [vm@multi-agent.io](mailto:vm@multi-agent.io)\n- [ping@airalab.org](mailto:ping@airalab.org)\n\nAlso, you can check out this [group.](https://vk.com/aira.monitoring)\n\nRobonomics board for air quality sensor, based on ESP8266. The device is designed for 6 - 24 volt power supply, using DC-DC converter DC MINI560.\n\n![plata](./images/sensors-connectivity/plata.png)\n\nThis board allows you to connect PM sensor:\n\n- [SDS011](https://cdn-reichelt.de/documents/datenblatt/X200/SDS011-DATASHEET.pdf)\n\nand additional sensors:\n\n- I2C interface:\n  - [BMP180](https://cdn-shop.adafruit.com/datasheets/BST-BMP180-DS000-09.pdf) - temperature and humidity\n  - [BME/P280](https://www.mouser.com/datasheet/2/783/BST-BME280-DS002-1509607.pdf) - temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure\n  - [HTU21D](https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Measurement-Specialties/HTU21D?qs=tx5doIiTu8oixw1WN5Uy8A%3D%3D) - temperature and humidity\n  - [CCS811 VOC SENSOR](https://www.sciosense.com/wp-content/uploads/documents/Application-Note-Baseline-Save-and-Restore-on-CCS811.pdf) - volatile Organic Compounds, CO2 equivalent\n- 1-Wire interface:\n  - [DHT22(AM2302)](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-Temperature_and_Humidity_Sensor_Pro/res/AM2302-EN.pdf) - temperature and humidity\n  - [DS18B20](https://cdn.sparkfun.com/datasheets/Sensors/Temp/DS18B20.pdf) - temperature.\n\nThere is also a smaller MINI model with aa shortened list of connectable devices. The source circuits for both models can be found at [full model](https://oshwlab.com/ludovich88/aira_sensor_rev0-1) and [MINI model](https://oshwlab.com/ludovich88/aira_sensor_d1_mini).\n\n### Assembly\n\nLet's take a closer look at the board: the board has several connector ports for connection - they are highlighted \nin blue and green. Consider the blue block of terminal block.\n![plata1](./images/sensors-connectivity/plata1.png)\n\nFrom left to right (all terminals are signed):\n- Terminal for connecting the power supply to the board. The recommended voltage is 12 volts.\n- Ground (point of zero potential). Serves both for connection of zero potential of the power supply, and for connection of sensors.\n- Supply of sensors. Configurable power output to which sensors are connected. The output can be set to 3.3 or 5 volts.\n- SDA terminal. Serial data line, is used to connect sensors via the I2C interface.\n- SCL/1-Wire terminal. Configurable terminal to which the serial clock line  is connected. Used to connect sensors via I2C or 1-Wire interface.\n\nSetting the power output for the sensor and selecting the interface is done by setting the jumpers, marked yellow in the image.\nThe jumpers are installed horizontally, the places for installing the jumpers are signed.\n\n***BE CAREFUL!!!*** You can choose the voltage for the power supply by setting only one jumper to 3.3 volts or 5 volts. Setting two jumpers to 3.3 and 5 volts will damage the device. The same rule works when choosing an interface for sensors, install only one jumper in place of I2C or 1-Wire. Installing two jumpers may damage the device.\n\nThere is also an additional block of inputs, marked green in the image.\n\n> There is a power switch on the left side of the blue box to force the board to reboot. It is in the ON position by default.\n\n\nAfter receiving the sensor, all that remains is to flash and configure it.
