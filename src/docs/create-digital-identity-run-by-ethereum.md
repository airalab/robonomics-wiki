One of the Robonomics services is [Digital Passport Registration](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/passport/) for arbitrary data. The service allows you to create a digital identity saving the hashes of the data to the public blockchain and assigning a unique address.

You may find "Digital passport registration" service in [Robonomics DApp](https://dapp.robonomics.network/) in the "Services" section or just follow this [direct link](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/passport/).

### 3. Sign the demand

### 4. Approve tokens

The service charges a small fee. But first you must approve the required amount of tokens to be spent from your account.

### 5. Accept the offer and sign the message again

{% roboWikiPicture {src:"docs/case_digital_passport_5.jpg", alt:"Send Order"} %}{% endroboWikiPicture %}

### 6. Have a look at the created passport

{% roboWikiPicture {src:"docs/case_digital_passport_6.jpg", alt:"The Digital Identity"} %}{% endroboWikiPicture %}

The process of registration takes some time. In the end you will see a link to the created identity.
