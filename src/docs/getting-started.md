## What is Robonomics

Robonomics platform provides tools for working with the robot economy network. Robonomics allow designers of smart cities and industry 4.0 zones to build trust among the [autonomous robots services](/docs/glossary#cyber-physical-system), provide [direct user access via dapp](/docs/glossary#dapp) for ordering products from autonomous factories and services of urban sensor networks. This in turn will allow us to put in place a decentralized system that globally monitors the activities of cyber physical systems.

The following chart describes what place Robonomics takes in the scenario:

## Robonomics Network quick start
**For newcomer's convenience core Robonomics developers came up with a [6 lessons learning curve](/docs/wschool2021-intro/)!**

You'll explore the serverless IoT architecture! Robonomics Web Services (RWS) is the basic infrastructural service for Robotics and IoT on top of Polkadot && IPFS.

Course graduates can launch a local relay chain and control a ROS-compatible device through cross-chain transaction.

**[Join Robonomics Developers Discord](https://discord.gg/jTxqGeF5Qy) to connect with community and get technical support.**
